<h2>Translator&rsquo;s Preface</h2>
<p>The story of Louis Charles, second son
of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette,
is one of the most pathetic in the history
of royalty, and has an added interest because
of the attempts of many romancers and some
historical writers to raise doubts as to his fate.
The brief space of the little Dauphin&rsquo;s life is measured
by the awful period of the French Revolution
and Reign of Terror. Franz Hoffmann, the
writer of the original (which was published under
the title of &ldquo;Ein K&ouml;nigssohn,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;A King&rsquo;s
Son&rdquo;), follows the ordinarily accepted version that
the Dauphin was separated from the King and
Queen and confined in the Temple, and that after
their execution he was deliberately and cruelly
allowed to waste away in body and become the
victim of hopeless disease, remaining thus until
death ended his sufferings and the inhuman barbarity
of his keepers. In the course of his narrative
the author touches upon the most striking events
of the Revolution, that &ldquo;dreadful remedy for a
dreadful disease,&rdquo; as it has been called, and brings
out in strong relief the character of the well-meaning
but weak King and imperious Queen, as well as
that of the brutal cobbler Simon, the Dauphin&rsquo;s
keeper; but the principal interest centres in the
pathetic figure of the little prince. The historic
doubts raised as to the Dauphin&rsquo;s fate also lend
interest to the tale. One of these has to do with
the identity of Naundorff, who passed himself off
as the Duke of Normandy, the Dauphin&rsquo;s title, and
the other with the Rev. Eleazar Williams of Green
Bay, Wisconsin, missionary among the Indians.
The claims put forth by friends of Williams attracted
widespread attention and provoked much
discussion in this country and France, half a century
ago, because of the extraordinary coincidences
attaching to the alleged identity. It is the generally
accepted verdict of history, however, that the
Dauphin was the victim of the Revolution and
died in the Temple in 1795, and as such he appears
in these pages. The details of his fate can never
be stated with accuracy, so involved and uncertain
is the tragic mystery, but Hoffmann&rsquo;s narrative is
undoubtedly correct in its general outlines. There
are almost as many different versions as there are
histories of that thrilling period.</p>

<h2>The Little Dauphin</h2>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="h2line1">Chapter I</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Sunny Days</span></h2>
<p>Within the grounds of the Tuileries,&mdash;that
splendid palace of the King of
France,&mdash;at the end of a terrace overlooking
the water, there was, in 1790,
a small garden surrounded by a neat trellis and adjoining
a pavilion occupied by the Abb&eacute; Daveaux,
tutor of the Dauphin, or Crown Prince, Louis
Charles.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>On a certain bright July morning in that year a
handsome, graceful boy about five years old entered
this garden. He was richly and carefully dressed,
and was accompanied by a small detachment of
soldiers in the uniform of the National Guard, who
followed him on foot to the gate in the trellis and
stationed themselves there as sentinels. The boy
bowed courteously to them and said, smiling: &ldquo;I
am sorry, gentlemen, my garden is so small I cannot
have the pleasure of receiving you in it, but I
will do the best I can,&rdquo; and quickly gathering a
handful of flowers, he proceeded to distribute them
among his escort with such winning sweetness that
the bearded soldiers could scarcely restrain their
emotion.</p>
<p>After busying himself for some time in this way,
the boy took from a corner one of the small but
handsomely finished garden tools that had evidently
been specially adapted to his use, and went industriously
to work removing the weeds which had sprung
up among the flowers, and spading the soil of a small
bed to prepare it for setting out some young plants
which he had brought with him in a pretty little
basket. He worked with such energy and absorption
that beads of perspiration stood on his forehead,
and he did not observe that his tutor, the Abb&eacute;
Daveaux, had entered the little garden and was
watching his labors with loving interest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>&ldquo;That will do, my Prince,&rdquo; said the Abb&eacute;, finally.
&ldquo;You must not fatigue yourself too much or you
will not be able to give proper attention to your
lessons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy immediately laid down his tool and
with a bright smile greeted his tutor, who gently
brushed the clustering curls from his flushed face.
As he stood there, glowing with health and breathless
from the exercise which had brought a bright
color to his cheeks, with the frank, fearless glance
of his great blue eyes shaded by dark lashes, the
wide, fair brow, the fresh red lips, the dimple in his
rounded chin, and the almost angelic expression of
innocence on his face&mdash;it would have been hard to
find a lovelier child. His figure was slender and
delicate, his motions full of grace and vivacity, while
in his manner and bearing there was something
noticeably distinguished, combined with a confiding
trustfulness that won all hearts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Universally admired for his beauty and beloved
for his nobility of mind, his tender heart, and the
sweet friendliness he showed to all with whom he
came in contact, this boy was Louis Charles, Dauphin
of France, destined in the ordinary course of
events to be the future ruler of one of the mightiest
kingdoms of the world. Tenderly beloved by his
parents, the unfortunate King Louis the Sixteenth
and the imperious Grand Duchess Marie Antoinette<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a>;
surrounded by all the pomp and splendor
of a kingdom, and sheltered with loving solicitude
from every shadow of evil, as yet he had known only
the sunny days of happy, careless childhood; but
already above him were gathering the dark clouds
which were to eclipse the sunshine of his life evermore
and transform the serene happiness of his parents
into bitter trouble and untold misery. Alas!
what a cruel fate had destiny reserved for this beautiful
boy whose blue eyes looked out so bravely
and trustfully upon the world! But of all this he
had little foreboding as he gave himself up to the
full enjoyment of his innocent happiness with all
the light-hearted unconsciousness of a child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just see, M. Abb&eacute;, how busy I have been this
morning!&rdquo; said the boy, after he had given the
usual morning greetings to his tutor. &ldquo;I have
taken out all the weeds and planted this bed with
fine asters, which will please my mother very much
when they blossom. You know, M. Abb&eacute;, how
much she loves flowers!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;I do, indeed, my Prince,&rdquo; answered M. Daveaux,
&ldquo;and it is very nice and thoughtful of you to take
her a nosegay every morning; but I cannot understand
why you exert yourself to do all that digging,
weeding, watering, and planting when a gardener
would do it for you in a few moments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little Prince shook his head earnestly. &ldquo;No,
no, M. Abb&eacute;,&rdquo; he replied after a moment&rsquo;s reflection;
&ldquo;my father gave me this garden so that
I should have the care of it. And besides,&rdquo; he
added with a charming smile, &ldquo;I must make these
flowers grow myself, because mamma would not
like them half so well if anyone else had done
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, my Prince,&rdquo; said the Abb&eacute;, surprised
and touched by the boy&rsquo;s remark, which
showed so much affection for his mother. &ldquo;Go on
planting your flowers, and I hope they may thrive
entirely to your satisfaction.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they are growing finely, M. Daveaux,&rdquo;
answered the Prince, proudly. &ldquo;You will see what
a large bunch I can pick in just a moment&rdquo;; and
with a zeal and energy inspired by his love for his
mother he examined all the flowers in his little
garden, selected the largest and freshest blossoms,
and bound them into a bouquet which he arranged
with much care and taste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, M. Abb&eacute;,&rdquo; said he, holding out his nosegay
with childish triumph, &ldquo;do you not think my
mother will be pleased with this? It makes me
very unhappy when the weather is bad and I cannot
work in my garden, for how can I be happy,
M. Abb&eacute;, when I have not earned mamma&rsquo;s first
kiss with my bouquet? But now I must go and
feed my rabbits, and then hurry to her with the
flowers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a corner of the garden there was a small enclosure
walled in with bricks, where some pretty
tame rabbits were kept by the Prince. They recognized
him with evident pleasure, and came quickly
at his call as he bountifully distributed among them
fresh cabbage leaves and carrots provided for the
purpose. After this visit to his pets, the Dauphin
turned back toward the palace to make his usual
morning call on his mother, but once more he was
detained.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>Before the iron railings that separated the garden
from the open street stood a poor woman, who was
gazing at the Prince with longing eyes, but had not
ventured to address him. Perceiving instantly that
she seemed to be in trouble, he approached her and
asked kindly: &ldquo;What is the matter, my good
woman? Can I do anything for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman burst into tears. &ldquo;Oh, my Prince,&rdquo;
she stammered, &ldquo;I am very poor and have a sick
child at home,&mdash;it is a boy, my Prince, and just as
old as you,&mdash;and he is waiting anxiously for my
return. But I cannot bear to go back to him with
empty hands!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a moment,&rdquo; replied the Prince, after he
had convinced himself that the woman was really
poor and needy. &ldquo;I am going to see my mother,
and will be back directly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With hasty steps he ran on, and disappeared in
the palace; but in less than ten minutes he was back
again with a beaming face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, my good woman,&rdquo; he said in his gentle
voice, as he handed her a bright new gold piece
through the railings, &ldquo;that is from my mother.
And this,&rdquo; he added, snatching one of the finest
roses from his garden, &ldquo;this is from me for your
sick boy. I hope he will soon be well again&rdquo;;
and before the astonished woman could utter her
thanks the little Dauphin had vanished again, hardly
hearing the loud acclamations of the crowd which
had gathered outside the palings and witnessed his
generous deed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>At no time was the young Prince gayer or more
charming than with his mother, whom he adored
above all the world. As she did not wish his mind
overtaxed with learning during his tender years, she
taught him herself the rudiments of his education
before giving him into the hands of his tutor, and
nothing could equal the motherly care and solicitude
she bestowed on the task. If the boy became weary,
the Queen would seat herself at the piano or harp
and play for him little melodies, full of expression,
which she had either learned or composed herself,
observing with pleasure that his ear was very sensitive
to the charm of melody; or she would sometimes
read to him fairy tales, fables, or stories from
history, to which the little Prince listened with the
liveliest interest. Every emotion aroused by these
appeals to his imagination showed itself on his sensitive,
animated features. Exclamations of wonder
or excitement occasionally escaped him at the recital
of stirring events or adventures which his mind
could readily grasp; but whenever anything escaped
his comprehension or was not clear to him, his brow
clouded, and a stream of questions immediately followed.
Nor was he satisfied until he fully understood.
At such times he often astonished those
about him with observations and reflections that
awakened the liveliest hopes for the future of the
royal child,&mdash;hopes unhappily doomed to be so
soon blasted!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>After the little Dauphin had made the poor
woman happy with his gift, he returned for a moment
to his mother to thank her again for the gold
piece, and then went to give the King his morning
greetings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this I hear, my dear Charles?&rdquo; said the
King, smiling and shaking his finger at the Prince.
&ldquo;M. Hue has been telling me strange things of
you.&rdquo; M. Hue was one of the Prince&rsquo;s attendants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What things, papa?&rdquo; asked the boy. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
remember doing anything bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No? Think well, Charles. Yesterday, while
you were reciting your lesson, you began to whistle.
Did you not deserve a rebuke for that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince colored. Then he answered quietly:
&ldquo;Yes, papa, I remember. I repeated my lesson so
badly that I whistled to myself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless you see it was heard,&rdquo; replied the
King. &ldquo;You may be forgiven for that, however,
but we have not come to the end yet. Afterwards
you were in such high spirits that you tried to run
away and dash through the rose-bushes in the garden.
M. Hue warned you, and said, &lsquo;Monseigneur,
a single one of those thorns might wound your face
badly, or even put out your eye!&rsquo; And what answer
did Monseigneur make?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somewhat abashed, the Prince lowered his eyes.
&ldquo;I said: &lsquo;It is the thorny path that leads to glory!&rsquo;
And is not that true, papa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King&rsquo;s face assumed a more serious expression.
&ldquo;Yes, yes, the principle is right,&rdquo; he
answered, &ldquo;but you have misapplied it, my child.
There is no glory in risking your eyesight merely
to gratify a mischievous impulse. If it had been a
question of killing a dangerous beast, of rescuing a
human being from peril, in short, if you had risked
your life to save another, that might have been
called glory; but your act, Charles, was simply
thoughtless and imprudent. Beside, child, you
had better wait and not talk of glory until you are
able to read the history of your ancestors and our
French heroes like Guesclin, Bayard, Turenne, and
many others who have defended our crown with
their blood.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>This mild but earnest exhortation made a deep
impression on the heart of the young Prince. He
seized his father&rsquo;s hand, kissed it, and said in a low
voice, &ldquo;Very well, dear papa, after this I will find
my glory in following your counsels and in obeying
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we are good friends again,&rdquo; answered the
King; &ldquo;and now we will look over your exercises
for a few moments, so that M. Hue and M. Daveaux
may be pleased with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King, as well as the Queen, observed with
pride the talents of his son, and it afforded him much
pleasure to be present during the lesson hours and
examine the exercises and copy-books. He frequently
instructed the Prince himself, and by his
praise or censure encouraged in the boy a habit of
diligence and attention to what was being impressed
upon his mind. Together with his wife he guided
the education of the young Prince, and even continued
the practice in later and less happy days,
when, deprived of his crown, he had to accustom
himself to the gloom of a prison cell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>Soon the Abb&eacute; Daveaux appeared, and the usual
instruction in religion, reading, history, and geography
began. The Prince was particularly attentive
on this day, for his father&rsquo;s gentle admonition had
sunk deep into his heart and spurred his zeal to
the utmost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been very bright and industrious
to-day, my Prince,&rdquo; said M. Daveaux, when study-time
was over, &ldquo;and I am glad, therefore, that I
have a pleasant piece of news for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What news?&rdquo; asked the Prince, quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&mdash;that a company of small soldiers has
been formed in Paris under the name of &lsquo;Regiment
of the Dauphin,&rsquo; which wishes to have you for its
Colonel. I am sure you will accept this post of
honor with pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, if papa will allow me!&rdquo; replied the
Prince, with sparkling eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your papa,&rdquo; answered the King himself, &ldquo;has
not only already given his consent, but is willing for
you to receive the young gentlemen who have come
to pay their respects to their new Colonel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come already? Where shall I find them?&rdquo;
asked the Prince, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In your garden,&rdquo; replied the King. &ldquo;M. Daveaux
will be good enough to accompany you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>Beaming with joy, the Crown Prince hastened
with his tutor to the garden, where he greeted the
little deputation, most of whom were not more than
four or five years older than himself, with graceful
courtesy and announced his readiness to accept the
post of Colonel of their regiment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now it will be adieu to your flowers and the
nosegays for your mamma, I suppose?&rdquo; said the
Abb&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; returned the Dauphin, gayly, &ldquo;reviewing
my Grenadiers will not prevent me from
taking care of my flowers. Some of these young
soldiers have little gardens of their own; they will
love the Queen, too, like their Colonel, and in the
future, instead of a single one, mamma will receive
a whole regiment of bouquets every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little soldiers loudly applauded their new
commander&rsquo;s speech, and the best relations were at
once established between them and continued without
a break for several weeks. His small Guards
afforded the Prince the greatest pleasure, until they
were dispersed in the stormy times which soon
followed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>By this time the day was considerably advanced,
and the Abb&eacute; was obliged to remind his pupil that
his mother would be waiting for him and he must
dismiss the envoys of the Regiment of the Dauphin.
The Prince gave his hand courteously to his little
comrades and followed his tutor to the Queen&rsquo;s
apartment. His reception, however, was by no
means such as he expected. His mother greeted
him with a very serious face and gave him only her
cheek to kiss instead of the usual embrace. Prince
Louis Charles, who was acutely sensitive, perceived
at once that something was amiss and looked at his
mother timidly and somewhat perplexed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What fault have I committed now, mamma?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, the young gentleman&rsquo;s conscience troubles
him already,&rdquo; replied the Queen. &ldquo;Perhaps he can
tell me about the trick that was played on the page
who attended him yesterday on the terrace. I hope
he will not attempt to deny it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince&rsquo;s delicate face grew crimson, for he
remembered very well to what his mother referred.
The day before, while they were walking together,
he had mischievously taken a flute from his companion&rsquo;s
pocket and hidden it in a fir-tree on the
terrace. In a faltering voice he confessed his
guilt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said the Queen; &ldquo;your confession
mitigates your fault somewhat, but nevertheless such
pranks cannot be passed over without punishment.
It is out of the question, of course, to imprison the
newly appointed Colonel of a regiment, but there is
Mouflet! Mouflet was with you at the time. He
was in a way the accomplice of his master, and since
that master may not be punished, Mouflet must
suffer for him. Let Mouflet be called and placed
in arrest for two hours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mouflet was a pretty little dog, dearly loved by
the Prince, and on this affection the Queen relied
in her punishment of the Dauphin. Nor was she
mistaken as to its effect.</p>
<p>Confined in a dark little cabinet, deprived alike
of his freedom and the sight of his young master,
poor Mouflet began to whine dolefully, to scratch
at the door, and finally to howl with all his might.
His lamentations found an echo in the tender heart
of the real culprit and filled it with pity and remorse.
Weeping, he hastened to his mother and
tearfully kissed her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, mamma,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Mouflet is not the
one who has done wrong. Why should the poor
dog be punished? Oh, please set him free and put
me in his place!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>Delighted as the Queen was at this proof of the
Prince&rsquo;s sense of justice, and gladly as she would
have pardoned him, she felt that for the sake of
discipline she must not yield to her feelings, and
replied gravely: &ldquo;Very well, since you feel that
you deserve the punishment, I will not prevent you
from enduring it. You may release poor Mouflet
and be locked up in his place for an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rejoiced at this decision, the Prince accepted his
sentence at once and even extended it beyond the
allotted time. But this was not all. In the solitude
of his prison he began to reflect upon his
behavior, and told himself that even though he had
atoned for his fault the wrong had not yet been
righted. He resolved that as soon as he was at
liberty he would go to the garden, get the flute
from its hiding-place, and give it back to his playmate
with a request for forgiveness. A loving
glance, a tender caress from his mother, were the
rewards of his victory over himself; and these signs
that he was forgiven made the little Prince so happy
and contented that for the rest of the day he was
the most polite and well-behaved of boys and gave
not the slightest occasion for a word or even a look
of reproof.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>Some days later, on the fourteenth of July, 1790,
a great <i>f&ecirc;te</i> was held on the Champ de Mars<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a>
in Paris, as in all the other cities of France, to celebrate
the inauguration of the new <i>r&eacute;gime</i>. The storm of
the Revolution which had broken out in the previous
year seemed to have passed away with this celebration,
and there was a general feeling of hope
and cheerful expectancy even among the opponents
of the new order of things. All the people, without
distinction of rank or class, had contributed to the
erection of a huge amphitheatre-like structure built
around the Champ de Mars, and in its construction
had treated one another like members of one
great family. Even the heavy gusts of rain which
ushered in the long-talked-of day failed to dampen
the ardor of the deputies and the vast throng of
people assembled there. The endless processions
followed each other in perfect order; and at last the
sun burst forth triumphantly from the mists and
rain clouds. First, Lafayette<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a> mounted the steps
of the high altar erected under the open sky, where
Talleyrand,<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a> Bishop of Autun, with sixty priests,
read the Mass and consecrated the banners of the
eighty-three districts of France, and swore, with
the colors of Paris in his hand, in the name of the
National Guard and the army of France, to be true
to the law and the King; then the President of the
National Assembly, rising from his seat at the right
of the King, took the same oath; and finally the King
himself arose and swore with uplifted arms to use all
the power bestowed on him by the law and the new
Constitution for their maintenance. At this instant,
while cannon thundered and trumpets blared, loud
shouts arose. The Queen, who was on a raised dais
beside the throne, carried away by the excitement of
the moment, lifted her son, the Dauphin, high in
her arms to show him to the people and also to let
him share in the oaths. The lovely child, smiling and
radiant, stretched out his innocent arms as though
to invoke a blessing from Heaven upon France,
whereat the multitude that witnessed the charming
sight broke forth into cheers and deafening huzzas
that rent the ragged clouds and penetrated to the
heavens above.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>The envoys of the people thronged about the
little Dauphin to offer him their loyalty and homage,
which the Prince received with such grace and
childish dignity that the enthusiasm broke out afresh,
and thousands of hearts vowed unswerving allegiance
to this child whose innocent breast seemed to harbor
no thoughts but those of peace and good-will
to men. The King and Queen embraced each other,
many eyes were filled with tears, and a general reconciliation
seemed to have closed forever the abyss
of the Revolution which had threatened to engulf
unhappy France.</p>
<p>These were still sunny days; but, alas! they
were the last to shine upon the well-meaning King
and his unfortunate consort. Fate had doomed them
to misfortune, and &ldquo;misfortune travels swiftly.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">Chapter II</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Night of Varennes<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a></span></h2>
<p>Soon after the celebration of the new <i>r&eacute;gime</i>,
the Hydra of the Revolution, which had
been for a short time trodden into the dust,
again lifted its poisonous head. Those evil
geniuses of France, Robespierre, Marat, and Danton,
vied with one another in their efforts to disturb the
peace of the country which had been secured with
such difficulty, and by calumnies against the King
to sow the seeds of hatred and distrust of him
among the people.</p>
<p>They succeeded only too well. The National
Assembly issued an unprecedented order to the
effect that the King should not absent himself from
Paris for more than twenty-four hours; and if he
should leave the kingdom, and not return at the
request of the Assembly, he should be deposed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>Notwithstanding this order, the King determined
on a journey to St. Cloud. At eleven o&rsquo;clock in the
morning he attempted to start, but his carriage was immediately
surrounded by a dense throng of people.
A troop of mutinous soldiers locked the doors of the
palace, and with threats and shouts levelled their
bayonets at the breasts of the horses. All Lafayette&rsquo;s
efforts to appease the tumult were in vain, and after
two hours of struggle and dispute, during which the
King was forced to bear the grossest insults and
abuse, he was obliged to return to his apartments.</p>
<p>The little Dauphin, who had been eagerly looking
forward to the journey and making a thousand
plans for his sojourn in St. Cloud, was much grieved
over this failure of his hopes. To divert his mind
from the disappointment, after he had returned to
his room the Abb&eacute; Daveaux gave him a volume
of &ldquo;The Children&rsquo;s Friend,&rdquo; by
Berquin,<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a> to look
at. The Prince opened it at random, and cried
in astonishment: &ldquo;Just see, M. Abb&eacute;! what a
curious thing! Look at this title, &lsquo;The Little
Captive&rsquo;! How strange!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>The child had foretold only too well in applying
the name of little captive to himself. He, as well
as his parents, was in fact a prisoner of the people
and the National Assembly, and their numerous
jailers behaved so rudely and disrespectfully to
them that the situation soon became unbearable.
The unvarying kindness and patience of the King
served only to multiply the complaints and calumnies
of his enemies. Even the Queen could no
longer appear at her window without exposing
herself to insults and invectives. At last the yoke
became so heavy that nothing remained but to
escape, or break it by force. The kindly heart of
the King shrank from the latter course, which could
not be accomplished without bloodshed, so the
necessary preparations were made for flight&mdash;the
only recourse left him. It was determined to seek
a refuge in some frontier town and from there to
carry on negotiations with the arrogant Assembly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>The King was not entirely without loyal friends.
By means of a secret correspondence, an arrangement
was made with the Marquis de Bouill&eacute;,<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a> a
lieutenant-general at the head of an important army
corps. The troops in Champagne, Alsace, and
Lorraine were placed under his command, and he
also guarded the frontier from Switzerland to the
Moselle and the Sambre. It was arranged between
him and the King that the latter should go to
Montm&eacute;dy, a strong post situated conveniently
near the frontier. The Marquis proposed, in order
to lessen the danger, that the party should separate,
the Queen with the Dauphin going first; but the
King answered: &ldquo;If we are to be saved, it must be
together or not at all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>On the 29th of April, 1791, the King wrote to
M. Bouill&eacute; to procure a coach for the journey,
large enough to accommodate himself and his entire
family; but the general tried to persuade him to
take, instead, two small, light English travelling-carriages,
such as were used at that time, which
would not attract attention. The King unfortunately
would not listen to this suggestion, a seemingly
trivial circumstance, which brought about
disastrous results. Before he left Paris, he wished
to relieve the Marquis from any responsibility in
the matter, and sent him therefore a written order
to station troops along the road from Ch&acirc;lons to
Montm&eacute;dy, for the purpose of guarding the safety
of the persons of the King and his family.</p>
<p>Their departure was fixed for the night of June
nineteenth, but was deferred at the last moment by
an unfortunate occurrence. One of the Queen&rsquo;s
waiting-women, who, it was feared, might betray the
plan if she had the least suspicion of it, was dismissed
from her service that very day, so the journey was
postponed for twenty-four hours. We shall soon
see how this fact also contributed to the failure of
the ill-fated undertaking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>Haste was imperative. The plan had already begun
to excite suspicion; for it had become necessary
to take several persons into the secret, who did not
guard it with proper care. Even the lower domestics
in the Tuileries whispered of it among themselves,
and the rumor, spreading abroad, excited the
populace to such a degree that the police were formally
notified. This report naturally resulted in the maintenance
of a still stricter surveillance over the palace.
The royal family was constantly watched in the
most offensive way; the people even became so
bold as to lock the King and Queen in their own
apartments at night; and mattresses were placed
before the doors for the guards to sleep on, so that
no one could leave the rooms without stepping over
the bodies of their jailers. This difficulty, however,
had been foreseen, and an effort made to surmount
it. Some months before this, a door had been so
skilfully cut in the woodwork of the chamber occupied
by the King&rsquo;s sister, Madame &Eacute;lisabeth,<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a>
that
only the closest scrutiny could discover it. This
door opened on a small staircase, which led to a
vaulted passage separating this room from that of
the Queen. A similar door had been made in the
royal apartment, and both fitted with keys which
turned so easily they could be opened instantly,
without noise or delay. Finally, the precaution had
been taken to conceal them by means of large cupboards
or presses, that opened on both sides and hid
the secret doors without preventing passage through
them. In this way one room could be easily reached
from the other, and by means of the passage, access
gained to the interior of the palace, from whence
it would be easy to reach the open air and freedom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>On the twentieth of June, at ten o&rsquo;clock in the
morning, the little Dauphin was working in his garden
at the end of the Tuileries; at eleven, the Queen
went to hear mass with her attendants, and on her
return from the chapel ordered her carriage to be in
readiness at five in the afternoon. The day passed
as usual; but the elder sister of the Dauphin noticed
that her parents seemed anxious and agitated, and
confided this observation to her brother. At five
o&rsquo;clock the Queen took a little drive with her children,
and seized this opportunity to impress upon
them that they must not be alarmed at anything
that might occur in the course of the evening or
night. The children were clever enough to perceive
their mother&rsquo;s meaning, and the little Prince assured
her she might be quite easy with regard to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>After the King and his family had eaten their
evening meal at the usual hour, all retired to their
apartments. The Dauphin was put to bed at nine
o&rsquo;clock, the Princess, his sister, at ten; the Queen
retired at half-past ten, and the King a few moments
later. The servants were given the seemingly necessary
orders for the following morning; the doors
were locked, the sentries took their usual precautions,
and at Madame &Eacute;lisabeth&rsquo;s door the guard was
doubled. But scarcely had the serving-people withdrawn,
when the King, the Queen, and Madame
&Eacute;lisabeth carefully arose, dressed themselves quickly,
and in a few moments were ready for the journey.
The Queen went into her daughter&rsquo;s room to awaken
her and her waiting-woman, Madame Brunier. She
acquainted the latter with the plan for escape, informed
her that she and Madame de Neuville had
been chosen to accompany them, and requested her
finally to dress the Princess as quickly as possible
and bring her into the Dauphin&rsquo;s chamber. The
clothes had been already prepared. The dress for
the little Princess was of cheap brown stuff and very
simply made, in order that the rank of the fugitive
might not be suspected, while the Dauphin was
dressed as a girl, and looked most charming in his
new costume. But, aroused from his first sleep at
eleven o&rsquo;clock at night, he could not understand
what was going on about him, and fell asleep again
immediately. His sister awoke him once more,
and whispered:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&ldquo;Charles, Charles! what do you think of all
this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which he replied sleepily, and with half-closed
eyes, &ldquo;I think it is a comedy we are going to act,
because we are dressed up so strangely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the time fixed for departure, both children
were taken out into the passage, where they were
joined a moment later by the Queen. She took
them by the hand and led the way, Madame de
Neuville, Madame Brunier, and Madame de Tourzel,
the Dauphin&rsquo;s governess, following. They descended
a staircase, hurried through several dark
corridors to a door in the farthest corner of the
courtyard, which had been left unguarded, and near
which a hackney-coach was standing. It had
been agreed they should not all leave the palace
together, for fear of attracting the attention of the
sentries, so the Queen lifted her children into the
coach, entrusted them to the care of Madame de
Tourzel, and returned to the palace. The driver
was Count Axel Fersen<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a>&mdash;a Swedish gentleman
who, next to M. de Bouill&eacute;, enjoyed the highest
favor at court. He drove out of the courtyard,
took a roundabout way through the quarter to
elude observation, and then came back to the
Petit Carrousel, where he was to wait for the rest
of the party. While they stood there, Lafayette&rsquo;s
carriage drove by, surrounded by torch bearers;
he was on his way to the Tuileries, but recognized
no one and observed nothing; for that matter, the
Dauphin was in the bottom of the coach, hiding
under his governess&rsquo;s skirt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>An hour passed, but no one came. Finally
Madame &Eacute;lisabeth arrived, and not long after her
the King appeared. The Queen was only a short
distance behind him, but she caught sight of Lafayette&rsquo;s
carriage again approaching, and, afraid of
being discovered, hurried down one of the narrow
streets near by. Confused by the labyrinth of alleys,
she lost her way, and dared not ask it of anyone
so near the palace. Thus another precious half-hour
was lost before she found the coach again.
At last they started, and reached the new Barrier
of the suburb St. Martin, without further mishap,
where they found the large travelling-coach awaiting
them, drawn by five strong horses, although it
was fully two hours past the time agreed on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>It was the shortest night of the year, and the
first faint light of dawn was already visible in
the sky, as, shortly after two o&rsquo;clock, the carriage
containing the royal family rattled up. The change
to the waiting travelling-coach was made without
delay, and Count Fersen swung himself onto the
box beside his coachman, Balthasar Sapel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drive on, quickly!&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;Make
haste!&rdquo; They started forward. Their <i>r&ocirc;les</i> were
distributed as follows: Madame de Tourzel was to
appear as the Baroness von Korff; the Princess
and the Dauphin as her daughters Amalie and
Algan; the Queen passed as the children&rsquo;s governess,
Madame Rochet; Madame &Eacute;lisabeth personated
the waiting-woman called Rosalie; the King
took the part of <i>valet-de-chambre</i> under the name of
Durand; and three officers of the bodyguard who
accompanied them, Messieurs de Maldent, de
Moustier, and de Valory, passed for servants and
couriers. All were suitably dressed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>Count Fersen, on the coachman&rsquo;s box in front,
constantly cracked the whip and urged the driver
on. &ldquo;Faster! faster! Balthasar!&rdquo; he called to
him. &ldquo;Do not spare the horses&mdash;they will have
time enough to rest when we are safe with the
regiment.&rdquo; The horses almost flew, but their furious
speed seemed slow to the anxious impatience of
the Count, who realized but too well the dangers
of the enterprise. Bondy was reached in half an
hour, and here, through the forethought of M. de
Valory, six fresh horses were waiting for them,
while he himself rode on in advance to Claye to
take the same precaution there. At Bondy, Count
Fersen took leave of them with reluctance, and
returned to Paris, to escape as soon as possible
to Belgium.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>At Claye the travellers found the waiting-maids,
Brunier and de Neuville, who had left Paris a little
before them in a postchaise. It was important to
continue their journey without delay, but the new
travelling-coach already needed some repairs, and
again invaluable time was lost. At the village of
&Eacute;toges, between Montmirail and Ch&acirc;lons, they had
an anxious moment, fearing themselves recognized.
The King, with his usual carelessness, allowed himself
to be seen too often. He descended from the
coach more than once, walked up one or two of the
long hills with the children, and even talked with
some peasants they met. At Ch&acirc;lons, where they
arrived about noon, they were indeed recognized by
the postmaster and some other persons who had
seen the King; but they were shrewd and loyal, and
did all in their power to aid the fugitives, harnessing
the horses themselves and urging the postilions
to depart. The travellers were amply supplied with
provisions, and nowhere was a stop made for meals.
At the bridge in Sommevesle, the first post-station
after Ch&acirc;lons, they should have found a detachment
of hussars to act as escort on the road to
Montm&eacute;dy; but when they reached there at six
o&rsquo;clock, not a hussar was to be seen. It was discovered
afterward that six hours earlier the troops
had been at their post, according to orders; but,
having already waited some hours, a longer stay
was deemed imprudent, owing to the suspicious attitude
of the people. M. de Choiseul, the commander
of the hussars, fearful of arousing fresh
disturbances in Ste. Menehould, had then given
orders to avoid that town in their retreat, and make
their way by cross-roads; and hence the travellers
missed them altogether. Again the unfortunate
consequences of these delays were felt; but even
worse results were to follow. At Ste. Menehould
an escort of the King&rsquo;s dragoons should have been
waiting; but their leader, Captain d&rsquo;Andoins, had
been forced to go to the town hall to account for
the presence of his troops, which had alarmed the
now excited populace, and was held there virtually
a prisoner, while his troopers unsaddled their horses
and dispersed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>It was here that the King, uneasy over the failure
of their plans, and putting his head out of the
coach window, was recognized by the postmaster
Drouet.<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a> The sight of the King struck the fellow
with amazement; he compared the head of the
traveller with that of the King stamped on an assignat
(the paper money used at that time), and his
malignant expression betrayed his thoughts. The
Queen caught his evil smile and felt her heart sink;
but they passed on without hindrance, and she gradually
forgot her fears. The traitor Drouet, however,
lost no time in profiting by his discovery. He
communicated it at once to the town council, and
the whole village was in commotion. At that moment
a special messenger arrived from Ch&acirc;lons, confirming
the news of the King&rsquo;s escape. It was resolved
that Drouet, accompanied by a former dragoon
of the Queen&rsquo;s regiment, should start instantly in
pursuit of the fugitives, and, in case he succeeded
in overtaking them, place them under arrest. In
hot haste they mounted, and set off at furious speed
in the direction taken by the royal party.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>Meanwhile M. de Damas, with a company of
dragoons, had arrived at Clermont the previous
afternoon, at five o&rsquo;clock, with orders to wait there
for the King, and as soon as he had passed to follow
him along the road to Varennes. They remained
at their post till nightfall, when Damas ordered his
troopers&rsquo; horses to be unsaddled and allowed the
men to disperse. Half an hour later the coach
arrived, and continued on its way without stopping.
M. de Damas, who saw it pass, sent an officer to
summon the dragoons in haste from their quarters.
The town was soon in great excitement; the council
was disturbed; discussions grew more and more
heated. When Damas finally gave the signal to
mount, the troopers refused to obey, and it was with
the greatest difficulty he persuaded them to follow
him&mdash;another link in the chain of fatalities!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>The King&rsquo;s coach had scarcely left Clermont when
Drouet himself arrived, obtained a fresh mount,
and set off again in hot pursuit. One of the King&rsquo;s
bodyguard was riding in advance of the coach as
courier, another behind it as rear guard. Beside
these, Damas, when he saw Drouet ride off, had
sent one of his officers to overtake and stop him.
This man had almost succeeded in his attempt,
when, favored by the darkness, the traitor turned
off into by-ways known only to himself, and,
thoroughly familiar with the country, reached Varennes
shortly after eleven o&rsquo;clock, fully an hour
before the King and his family arrived there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>Varennes was a secluded little village and had no
post-house, but a place in the outskirts of the town,
where he might obtain a change of horses, had been
so carefully described to the King that he had no
difficulty in finding it. Here they stopped, expecting
to get the horses, but nothing was to be seen of
them. In vain the King knocked on the door; no
one answered. As a matter of fact, the plan had
been changed at the last moment, owing to the disturbances
existing all over the country, and the
horses had been sent to an inn on the other side of
the river; but, through more misunderstandings and
errors, someone had neglected to notify the King.
Lights were still visible in the house, and the Queen
herself alighted from the coach and tried to obtain
some response from the inmates; but her hope of
obtaining information by some chance was not realized,
and half an hour was lost. Drouet knew how
to make the most of the time. When at last the
travellers were forced to abandon the attempt and
re-enter the coach, the postilions refused to go
any farther, pretending that their horses were too
exhausted to continue the journey. Just then the
courier returned, bringing with him a man in a
dressing-gown and with a nightcap on his head.
As he approached the royal couple they demanded
impatiently: &ldquo;Where are our horses, fellow? Tell
us at once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your horses!&rdquo; he shouted, flinging himself
almost inside the vehicle. &ldquo;That I cannot say; but
I know another secret I will not tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know Frau von Korff?&rdquo; asked
Madame de Tourzel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but I know something better
than that&rdquo;; and with these words he disappeared
again. At the Queen&rsquo;s entreaties, the postilions
finally consented to drive the coach at least through
the town. The travellers now believed themselves
safe; they attributed this incident, like the other
mishaps of their journey, to some error or miscalculation,
and, full of hope, saw themselves already
under the protection of Bouill&eacute;&rsquo;s loyal troops. But
alas! matters were soon to assume a different aspect.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>Rightly to understand what follows, it should be
explained that Varennes is built on the side of a
hill, and consists of an upper and lower town connected
by a bridge across the Aire, which flows between.
At that time the town was approached
from Clermont, not as now by way of a fine square,
but through a narrow street ending in an arched
passageway, guarded by a heavy gate which could
be closed at will. This archway was built under a
tower, which is still standing; on one side was a
church, long since destroyed, and on the other
a small inn called the Bras d&rsquo;Or, kept by the Le
Blanc family. The gateway was used as entrance
to the town in time of peace, and the inn served as
a sort of watch-house. Beyond the passage was the
bridge, and it was here that Drouet had placed the
ambuscade which was to prevent the King&rsquo;s farther
progress. The host of the Golden Arm tavern was
also an officer of the National Guard. Aroused by
Drouet, he ran to call up the mayor of the town, M.
Sance; then he and his brother armed themselves,
and, summoning several of the National Guard, stationed
themselves before the entrance to the archway.
Sance meanwhile had hastened to alarm the
town, and sent out messengers to the nearest villages.
His son Georges, a captain of grenadiers, took
command of the guard, and while his other children
were running through the town at their father&rsquo;s
command, shouting &ldquo;Fire! Fire!&rdquo; M. Drouet,
accompanied by a notary called Regnier and some
of the townspeople, brought up a loaded wagon,
which they placed diagonally across the bridge to
obstruct its passage. All the preparations were
complete, when the expected vehicle was heard
approaching. It passed through the upper town
without interruption, the houses apparently all dark
and silent, and came rapidly on, until, just as it
reached the dark archway under the tower, the
horses were brought to a sudden standstill by the
barricade. At the same instant there sounded from
all sides the cry, &ldquo;Halt, there! Halt!&rdquo;&mdash;a cry
issuing from the rough throats of ten armed men,
who now emerged from the darkness. They threw
themselves upon the horses, seized the postilions,
sprang to both doors of the coach, and harshly demanded
of the travellers who they were.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;Frau von Korff, with her family!&rdquo; came the
answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; returned a voice, &ldquo;but you
will have to prove it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the first shout and the first gleam of weapons,
the officers of the bodyguard had leaped from their
places with their hands on their concealed knives,
ready at a signal from the King to make use of
them. But Louis the Sixteenth nobly forbade them
to use force, and the hostile musket barrels remained
pointing toward the coach. Drouet seized a light,
held it up to the King&rsquo;s face, and, without calling
him by name, ordered him to alight and show his
passport to the mayor. The King, still clinging
to the hope that he had not been recognized,
descended from the coach, his family following him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>As the party passed up the street, they saw some
hussars arriving; it was M. de Choiseul&rsquo;s force,
which should have waited at the bridge in Sommevesle.
The National Guard, whose numbers had
increased, allowed them to pass, but were ready
nevertheless to resist any attempt at rescue. By
this time the malicious activity of Drouet had produced
its results. The alarm bell was rung, the
drums beat, all Varennes was astir. Thousands of
peasants came flocking in from neighboring towns,
and the villages through which the King had passed
were thrown into wild excitement by the news of his
flight.</p>
<p>The mayor&rsquo;s house, whither the royal family was
conducted, contained two rooms on the upper floor,
reached by a spiral staircase. One of them overlooked
the street, the other the garden. The King
was lodged in the back room, but, as there was a
connecting door between, he could see all that
passed in the street. A dense throng of people
had gathered there, and increased every moment.
Sance at first pretended not to recognize his illustrious
guests, and, treating them as ordinary travellers,
explained that the horses could go no farther,
and besought them to remain and rest until fresh
relays could be obtained. But this mask of hypocrisy
was soon thrown aside, and he as well as
Drouet began to overwhelm the King with cruel
taunts and bitter invectives. They accused him
directly of intending to escape to foreign lands for
the purpose of joining and assisting in an invasion
of France by her enemies. In vain the King attempted
to deny his rank and claim the liberty
accorded to all travellers. They declared flatly that
he and his family were recognized, and continued
their jeers and abuse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; suddenly said the Queen, with
dignity&mdash;she had not hitherto spoken a word&mdash;&ldquo;since
you recognize him as your King, then see
that you treat him as such!&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words induced the King to resume his
natural frankness of manner, which he had with difficulty
concealed. He explained freely the motives
which had prompted him to take this journey;
spoke of his earnest desire to learn the real needs
of the people whose welfare was dear to him; resolutely
denied the false report that he wished to
escape from France and make his home in a foreign
land, and even offered to entrust himself to
the National Guard of Varennes, and let them accompany
him to Montm&eacute;dy or any other place in
the kingdom where his personal freedom might be
assured.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>The naturally warm and candid eloquence of the
King did not fail in its effect. Sance was almost
ready to give way, and if it had depended only on
him they might have been allowed to proceed.
But Drouet had no idea of allowing his prey to
escape him now; he became still more violent, and
declared that his own head might answer for it if
the King were not sent back to Paris. At this
moment, too, an incident occurred in the street
which decided the fate of the royal fugitives. A
conflict arose between the officers who were on the
King&rsquo;s side and the National Guard. M. de Goguelat
crowded his horse against the leader of the
Guard and drew his sword; the Major discharged
his pistol at Goguelat and wounded him in the
shoulder, causing his horse to rear and throw him.
M. de Choiseul&rsquo;s hussars looked on, but made no
motion to interfere, and it was evident that they
could no longer be depended on. All hope was
now lost; the King&rsquo;s only chance lay in the possible
arrival of Bouill&eacute; and his soldiers, but Bouill&eacute; did
not appear. Instead, fresh re&euml;nforcements of the
National Guard came pouring in from all sides to
assist their comrades, and the ever increasing throngs
overflowed the little town&mdash;a town destined from
this night to claim a melancholy place in history.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>Between six and seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning,
two messengers arrived from the National Assembly,
M. de Romeuf, Lafayette&rsquo;s aide-de-camp, and
Bayon, an officer of the National Guard in Paris.
They brought a decree of the Assembly, ordering
the King to be taken back to his capital wherever
he might be found. Bayon entered alone. Fatigue
and excitement had given a still darker cast to his
naturally gloomy expression. With tangled hair
and disordered attire, he approached the King, and
stammered confusedly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sire, you are aware ... all Paris is in arms ...
our wives and children even now perhaps are being
massacred ... you will not go any farther away....
Sire, the welfare of the country ... yes,
Sire ... our wives and children....&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these words, the Queen with a sudden movement
seized his hands and, pointing to the sleeping
children on the bed, exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, am I not also a mother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your business here?&rdquo; demanded the
King.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sire, a decree of the Assembly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My comrade has it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words, he opened the door and disclosed
M. de Romeuf, who, overcome with emotion,
was leaning against a window in the front room.
His face was wet with tears. He approached with
downcast eyes, holding out a paper, which the King
took from him and glanced through rapidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there is no longer a King in
France!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children had awakened by this time, and the
little Dauphin became the object of special interest.
Some admired his beauty, and others asked him
questions about his journey and the Tuileries, to
which the sleepy child scarcely responded, but only
gazed at his mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Charles,&rdquo; his sister whispered to him,
&ldquo;you were mistaken, this is no comedy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew that long ago!&rdquo; returned the poor
child, shrugging his shoulders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>Meanwhile, the crowd, excited almost to frenzy
by Drouet, were demanding the King&rsquo;s departure,
and their shouts and cries came surging upward
from the street. Some of the most violent even
tried to break into the house and bring him out by
force, while above all the tumult arose a scream of
&ldquo;Drag him out! Drag him into his coach! We
will have him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King attempted to appease them by appearing
at the window, seeking to gain time, in the faint
hope that any moment might bring Bouill&eacute; and
rescue. As a last resort, one of the waiting-women
declared she was violently ill, and the King and
Queen refused to desert her. But all their efforts
were of no avail, and the King realized at last that
further resistance was hopeless. He requested to
be left alone with his family for a moment, and, after
a brief and sorrowful consultation, he yielded and
announced himself ready to depart. The royal
mother took her son in her arms and carried him
herself to the coach. It was half-past seven when
they started on their return journey&mdash;alas! just a
quarter of an hour too early!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>Only a few moments after they had gone, a body
of troops appeared on the heights overlooking
Varennes in the direction of Verdun. It was the
son of M. de Bouill&eacute; with the cavalry. He tried
to cross the river by a ford, the bridge being defended,
but was unable to accomplish it, and thus
the last chance of saving the King was lost. General Bouill&eacute;
arrived soon after at the head of his
Royal German Regiment, in full gallop, only to
learn when he reached Mouza that the King had
left Varennes and that he was too late. Broken-hearted,
he turned his horse&rsquo;s head, and with his
faithful and now dejected troops began his retreat
to the frontier.</p>
<p>The royal party was already far from Varennes.
Surrounded by five or six thousand infuriated peasants,
the King was a prisoner in the same vehicle
that was to have borne him to safety and freedom.
It was only allowed to proceed at a foot-pace, and
a whole hour was consumed in reaching Clermont.
This town, like all the others through which they
passed, was filled to overflowing. Everywhere the
shops were closed, the people beside themselves
with excitement, and hundreds of frantic voices yelled
denunciations against the King, his nobles, and his
officers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>At three in the afternoon Ste. Menehould was
reached, and the mayor, Furci, a brave and honest
man, invited the Queen to partake of some refreshment
in the town hall. The weary travellers would
gladly have remained here some hours to rest, for
the little Prince, exhausted by his seven-hours&rsquo; journey
in the heat and dust, was suffering from
an attack of fever; but Bayon, the cruel commander
of this sad expedition, refused to gratify
their desire, and the unfortunate royal family were
obliged to continue their journey. Here the National
Guard of Varennes and Clermont left them,
and their place was taken by the Guard of Ste.
Menehould, who were relieved in their turn by those
of the next town.</p>
<p>One dreadful occurrence struck terror to the hearts
of the poor fugitives, and gave them a chill foreboding
of the horrors in store for them. On a hillside
near the village of Han, a brave nobleman, the
Marquis de Dampierre, rode up to greet the King
as he passed. Louis conversed with him for some
moments, and, as they parted with mutual good
wishes, M. de Dampierre bowed low and reverently
kissed the hand of his unhappy sovereign. This
token of respect was his death-warrant, for scarcely
had the loyal noble left the coach door when savage
voices shouted to him to halt, and as he unsuspectingly
obeyed, the mob fell upon him in a fury, tore
him from his horse, and slaughtered him without
pity before the eyes of the royal family. His head
was cut off and carried on the end of a spear for
some distance in front of their coach, as a trophy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>In the midst of such atrocities, it is gratifying
to hear of one instance which proves there were
still pure and noble hearts even in those frightful
times.</p>
<p>Young Cazotte was the commander of the National
Guard in the village of Piercy, and it was his
duty to receive the King at &Eacute;pernay, where a stop
was to be made at the Hotel Rohan. Cazotte&rsquo;s
men guarded the entrance to this palace, and he exacted
a solemn promise from them to allow no one
but the authorities to enter. Scarcely were these
measures taken when the King&rsquo;s coach arrived, almost
borne along by the waves of people. The
prisoners alighted amid a storm of curses, jeers, and
insults, directed especially against the Queen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ignore this madness, madame; God is over all!&rdquo;
said Cazotte to her in German.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>A grateful glance was her only answer as she
stepped forward, followed by her daughter, Madame
&Eacute;lisabeth, and Madame de Tourzel, the crowd
pressing close behind them. The little Dauphin
was carried by one of the soldiers. He was crying
and calling for his mother, who was out of sight.
Cazotte took him in his arms and tried to soothe
him, but his tears did not cease to flow until he was
carried into the room where the Queen had been
taken. Cazotte&rsquo;s delicate solicitude for the royal
family did not end even here; regardless of what the
consequences might be, he found a seamstress to
repair their clothing, which had been torn and
trampled on by the mob, furnished them with refreshments
and such conveniences as he was able to
obtain, and did all in his power to add to their
comfort till their departure put an end to his unselfish
and kindly service.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>Between &Eacute;pernay and Dormans they met the
commission sent out by the National Assembly, consisting
of Barnave, P&eacute;tion, and the Marquis de
Latour-Maubourg. They took their places in the
coach, but P&eacute;tion and Latour-Maubourg only remained
inside a short time, leaving Barnave alone
with the travellers. Barnave<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a> was one of the minor
deputies of the people, who amid all the tumult and
violence of the Assembly had preserved his nobility
and tenderness of heart. He felt sincere pity for the
unfortunate royal family, and, no longer restrained
by the presence of his colleague, P&eacute;tion,<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a> freely
offered his sympathy. The Queen was touched by
his considerate behavior, and joined in the conversation.
Barnave, on the other hand, to whom the
Queen had been painted in the most odious colors,
was astonished to find her so different from what
he had expected, and soon began to honor and respect
those he had been taught to hate and despise.
When the conversation ceased after a time, he took
the little Prince on his knee and talked with the
child, whose quick and lively, yet gentle, answers
impressed him deeply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you not sorry to go back to Paris?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am happy everywhere,&rdquo; answered the
Dauphin, &ldquo;as long as I have my father and mamma
with me, and my aunt, my sister, and Madame de
Tourzel, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, sir,&rdquo; said the King to Barnave, &ldquo;this is
indeed a sad journey for me and for my children!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>The mournful tone in which these words were
spoken moved the Dauphin deeply, and he took
his father&rsquo;s hand and kissed it. The King took
him in his arms and pressed him to his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not be unhappy, dear papa,&rdquo; said the child,
his eyes full of tears. &ldquo;Some other time we will
have a pleasanter journey!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At every change of post-horses, the other commissioners
came up to see what was passing inside
the coach. Surprised to find the heir to the throne
generally seated on Barnave&rsquo;s lap, P&eacute;tion finally
remarked in a spiteful tone, loud enough to be
heard by the travellers:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, Latour-Maubourg, Barnave is decidedly
the prop of future royalty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unhappy Barnave! He was forced ere long to
atone with his life for his newly won devotion to
the royal house and perish on the guillotine!</p>
<p>The remainder of the journey passed without
further incident. Sullen crowds gathered everywhere
to watch the King pass, but no one spoke or
showed any sign of good-will or favor toward him.
At Fert&eacute;-sous-Jouarre, however, the royal family
found one hearty welcome from the Regnards, at
whose house they dined. Although Madame Regnard
wore an apron to avoid recognition, Marie
Antoinette guessed her position at once, and approached
her, saying:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are the lady of the house, are you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was that only until your Majesty entered
it,&rdquo; answered Madame Regnard; a reply which
pleased the Queen and did full honor to the gracious
mistress of the house. When they were leaving,
the Queen said to the Dauphin:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son, thank the lady for her kindness, and
tell her we shall never forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little Prince immediately obeyed. &ldquo;Mamma
thanks you for your attention,&rdquo; said the child, &ldquo;and
I&mdash;I love you very much because you have given
her pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the coach arrived at Meaux a great tumult
arose; a priest nearly lost his life as the poor
Marquis had done, but Barnave rescued him, calling
out to the people in thundering tones:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frenchmen, would you become a pack of assassins?&rdquo;
Whereupon P&eacute;tion turned to Latour-Maubourg
and remarked with a sneer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It appears that our colleague&rsquo;s mission is not
only to protect royalty, but also the clergy!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>After Barnave&rsquo;s humane action, the Dauphin
willingly seated himself again on his knee and
talked to him until they reached Bossuet. At
eleven o&rsquo;clock that evening, after his colleagues
were asleep, Barnave was summoned to the King&rsquo;s
chamber, where he had a long conference with the
royal couple in regard to their situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evidently,&rdquo; said the Queen, at the end of it,
&ldquo;we have been deceived as to the real state of
public feeling in France.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They thanked Barnave warmly for his counsel,
and it was agreed that he should meet them secretly
in the Tuileries. From this time Barnave inwardly
swore allegiance to the throne, and kept his vow
faithfully to the end.</p>
<p>On the twenty-fifth of June, at seven in the evening,
the royal party arrived in Paris and entered the
Tuileries, before the gates of which a vast throng
had assembled, drunk with wine and fury and with
difficulty restrained from violence by the National
Guard. M. Hue lifted the little Dauphin from
the coach and carried him into his own apartment,
where he was soon in bed. The child was restless,
however, and his sleep very uneasy. In the morning
when he awoke, he said to his tutor, in a voice
loud enough to be heard distinctly by the guards
stationed in the room:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, M. Hue, I have had such a horrible
dream! I thought there were wolves and tigers
and all kinds of wild beasts around me all night
long, waiting to tear me to pieces!&rdquo;</p>
<p>M. Hue merely shrugged his shoulders, and
made no reply. The guards looked at each other
in astonishment, but no one ventured to reprove
the little Prince for his prophetic dream.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">Chapter III</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">In the Temple</span></h2>
<p>The French Revolution pursued its terrible
course, and war with Austria was finally
added to the internal disorders that distracted
the unhappy country. The people,
kept in a constant tumult by the false reports and
incessant assaults of the bloody Jacobins, hated
the King more than ever. Not content with depriving
him of his liberty and his throne, and subjecting
him to the deepest humiliations, the brutal mob
also demanded his life.</p>
<p>The first step toward this dreadful <i>d&eacute;nouement</i>
of the tragedy was the formal arrest of the royal
family and their imprisonment in the Temple.<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a> On
the thirteenth of August, 1792, they were taken to
this prison, the gates of which closed behind the
King, never to open for him again till he went forth
to lay his head under the guillotine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>The Temple was originally the residence of the
Grand Priors of the Knights Templars, and in the
thirteenth century occupied an extensive area, acquired
by the purchase of surrounding lands. In
the year 1792, however, little remained of it but
the so-called Tower of the Temple, a dark square
structure whose massive, frowning walls were flanked
by turrets at each corner. The Tower had four
stories. On the ground floor there was but one
large room, and a kitchen which was unused. The
first story consisted of an antechamber and a
dining-room, which communicated with a small
closet in one of the turrets. The second floor also
contained an anteroom and two apartments, one
of which the Queen and her daughter used as a
bedchamber, others being occupied by the Dauphin,
Madame &Eacute;lisabeth, and Madame de Tourzel. The
third floor was similar to the second, and here at
first the King was lodged with his attendants, M.
Hue and M. Chamilly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>A few faithful and devoted friends had chosen to
share the royal family&rsquo;s imprisonment, but this consolation
was not long permitted them. On the nineteenth
of August, two officers made their appearance
with an order from the Commune to remove all
persons not belonging to the Capet family. In
vain the Queen opposed the departure of the
Princess de Lamballe,<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a>
on the ground that she
was a relative. Their parting was most affecting;
both the royal children mingled their tears with
those of their elders, until the Princess and Madame
de Tourzel were forcibly separated from them and
carried away. Not a single attendant was left to
the unfortunate prisoners, except M. Hue, who,
much to his surprise, was permitted to remain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>Their life in the Tower of the Temple was very
sad and monotonous. The King arose every morning
between six and seven, and employed himself
with his devotions in his little oratory in the turret
until nine o&rsquo;clock, while M. Hue set the room in
order, laid the table for breakfast, and then went
down to the Queen. Marie Antoinette was up
even before the King, dressed herself and her son,
and heard him say his prayers. She kept her door
closed, however, until M. Hue appeared, in order to
prevent the officers, sent by the Commune to remain
in her room during the day, from entering any
earlier. At nine she went with her children and
Madame &Eacute;lisabeth to breakfast with the King,
and M. Hue took this opportunity to clean their
rooms and light the fires. At ten the whole family
returned to the Queen&rsquo;s room, where they remained
for the rest of the day. The King devoted himself
to his son&rsquo;s instruction, and the Queen heard the
Princess recite her lessons, while Madame &Eacute;lisabeth
taught them ciphering and drawing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>At one o&rsquo;clock, when the weather was fine and
Santerre, the commander of the guards, was present,
the whole family walked in the little garden of the
Temple, and the Dauphin amused himself with
childish sports and games. At two they had dinner,
after which came an hour of recreation, when
the children&rsquo;s amusements and laughter somewhat
enlivened the customary gloom. About four the
King would often take a short nap in his arm-chair,
while the Princesses sat by with a book or some
needlework, and the little Prince studied his lessons
or applied himself to his drawing and copy-book.
M. Hue superintended his work, and after it was
finished took him into the other room, where they
played ball or shuttlecock together.</p>
<p>At seven the family gathered around the table,
and read aloud from some religious or historical
work that would interest and instruct the children.
At eight M. Hue gave the Dauphin his supper in
Madame &Eacute;lisabeth&rsquo;s room; his parents were usually
present, and the King would often give him
little easy riddles to guess, the solution of which
occupied and diverted the child. After supper he
was undressed and said his evening prayer, which
usually was as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almighty God, who hast created and redeemed
me, to Thee I pray. Preserve the life of the King,
my father, and watch over the days of my family
also. Protect us from our enemies! Grant to
Madame de Tourzel strength to bear the sorrows
she is enduring on our behalf.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>After his prayer the Queen put him to bed, and
she and Madame &Eacute;lisabeth remained with him in
turn. As soon as the family supper was over, the
King came to say good-night to his son. After a
few moments&rsquo; talk, he pressed the hand of his wife
and sister, received the caresses of his children, and
returned to his own room, retiring at once to his
oratory, where he remained till midnight.</p>
<p>The Princesses sat together some time later, often
making use of this quiet hour to mend the family
clothing; and the King rarely composed himself to
sleep until after the guard was changed at midnight.
This was the daily routine as long as the King
remained a prisoner. The days passed in sadness
and humiliation, and there was scarcely an hour in
which they were not exposed to some fresh insult or
indignity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>At this time the little Dauphin was seven and a
half years of age. Through all their troubles, he
showed a courage and sweetness of disposition seldom
found even in the happiest natures. Sometimes
the seriousness of his thoughts would betray
itself by word or look; but he never failed to
respond to his parents&rsquo; affected cheerfulness with
all a child&rsquo;s unquestioning light-heartedness. Apparently
he thought no more of past greatness; he
was glad to be alive, and the only thing that made
him unhappy was his mother&rsquo;s tears. He never
spoke of his former amusements and pleasures,
showed no regrets, and seemed to have forgotten
all the joys of happier days. He applied himself
diligently to his studies, and with the aid of a good
memory he was far more advanced than most children
of his age. Through all this time of sorrow
and trouble, the poor little Prince had possessed one
unfailing consolation&mdash;his parents&rsquo; love and care.
But alas! the time was soon to come when he
would be deprived of this, too, and lose, first, his
father, then his mother.</p>
<p>The hard school of adversity developed all the
purity and nobility of the boy&rsquo;s nature, already so
richly endowed with warm affections and tender
sensibilities. Still a child in all his acts and feelings,
he was old enough at the same time to be able
to comprehend the misfortunes of the family, and
seemed to feel that he owed his parents even more
respect and attention than formerly, though his
lively fancies often made him forget their cruel situation.
He realized that they were prisoners, and
was discreet and prudent in his speech and behavior.
Never a syllable escaped him that could have
caused a painful memory or regret in his mother&rsquo;s
heart. How affectionate and yet how thoughtful and
quick-witted he was, one or two incidents will show.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>A stone-mason was at work one day on the wall
of the King&rsquo;s anteroom, making a place for heavier
bolts to be put on the door. While the workman
was eating his breakfast, the little Prince amused
himself by playing with his tools. The King took
the chisel and hammer from his son&rsquo;s hand to show
him how to use them, and worked at the wall himself
for a few moments. The mason, moved by a sudden
feeling of pity, said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;After you have gone away from here, you can
say you have worked on your own prison!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; answered the King, &ldquo;when and how
shall I get away from here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scarcely had he spoken the words, when the little
Dauphin threw himself into his father&rsquo;s arms and
burst into tears. The King dropped the hammer
and chisel: he, too, was much affected, and paced up
and down the room for some moments, struggling
with his emotions.</p>
<p>On another occasion the Prince had not shown a
coarse fellow named Mercereau all the respect to
which he considered himself entitled, whereupon he
addressed the child roughly with:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, boy! don&rsquo;t you know that liberty has
made us all equal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Equal</i>, as much as you please,&rdquo; answered the
Dauphin with a glance at his father, &ldquo;but you will
find it hard to make us believe that liberty has made
us free!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now the time was approaching which was to
separate the King from his loved ones forever.
After so many crimes committed by the French
people in the first intoxication and frenzy of their
power, there remained only the King&rsquo;s death to be
accomplished. Louis the Sixteenth, the mildest and
most just of kings, who had committed no crime but
that of loving his people too well, was summoned
before the blood-thirsty Convention which had
boldly set itself up to judge him. For several days
previously the treatment of the royal prisoners had
been even harsher than before. They were deprived
of every means of employment; even the ladies&rsquo;
needles were taken away from them, so that they
could no longer find distraction in their feminine
occupations, and to Louis these added brutalities
indicated but too plainly the issue of his trial. Indeed,
he was quite prepared for the worst; but what
troubled him most was the separation from his
family. During the session of the Convention he had
not been permitted to see them, and it was only with
the greatest difficulty and by the most ingenious expedients
that he was able to obtain news of them or
communicate with them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>At last the death sentence was pronounced, to be
executed on the following morning, and the King was
granted a final interview with his family. At half-past
eight in the evening his door was opened. The
Queen came first, leading the little Dauphin by the
hand; then her daughter, Marie Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, and
Madame &Eacute;lisabeth. They threw themselves into
the arms of the King, and for some moments a sorrowful
silence prevailed, broken only by sobs. The
Queen made a motion to her husband to take them
into his bedchamber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not there,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;we will go into the
dining-room; that is the only place where I can see
you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>They stepped into the adjoining room, which was
divided from the antechamber by a glass partition,
and the guards closed the door. The King sat down
with his wife and sister on either side; the Princess
knelt before him, and the Dauphin remained standing
between his father&rsquo;s knees. They all leaned
towards him and frequently embraced him, while the
King told them about his trial, and tried to excuse
those who had condemned him. He then gave
some religious admonitions to his children; charged
them to forgive those who were the cause of his
death, and bestowed his blessing upon them. The
Queen expressed her earnest desire that they might
all spend the night together, but he refused, saying
that he much needed to rest and compose his
thoughts. This melancholy scene lasted nearly
two hours. As the time drew near when it must
end, the King turned to his children again, and
made them give him a solemn promise never to be
revenged on his enemies. Then, taking the Dauphin
on his knee, he impressed upon him the
fulfilment of his last wishes, and concluded with
these words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son, you have heard all that I have said,
but since an oath is more sacred than words, swear
with uplifted hand that you will obey the last wishes
of your father.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>The little Prince obeyed and took the oath with
streaming eyes. The others, too, wept bitterly, for
the touching nobility of the King only intensified
their grief. And now for more than a quarter of
an hour not a word was spoken; only heart-rending
sounds of anguish filled the room, while
the whole family mingled their tears until exhausted
by sorrow. At length Louis rose, and the
others followed his example. A faithful servant,
named Cl&eacute;ry, who had managed to gain admittance
to the prison so as to be near the King, opened
the door. Louis supported his wife and held their
son&rsquo;s hand, while the Princess clasped her arms
tightly about her father and Madame &Eacute;lisabeth
clung to his arm. They took several steps toward
the outer door, and again heart-breaking sobs burst
forth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be calm!&rdquo; said the King; &ldquo;I will see you again
in the morning at eight o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You promise?&rdquo; they all cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I promise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why not at seven?&rdquo; asked the Queen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, at seven, then,&rdquo; replied the King.
&ldquo;Adieu!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This farewell was spoken in such a touching tone
that their grief became once more uncontrollable.
The Princess sank senseless at her father&rsquo;s feet, and
Cl&eacute;ry assisted Madame &Eacute;lisabeth to support her.
The King, to put an end to this distressing scene,
clasped them all once more in his arms most tenderly,
and tore himself from their embraces.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic2">

<p class="caption"><i>The King&rsquo;s last farewell</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;Farewell! Farewell!&rdquo; he said again with a
breaking heart, as he returned to his room.</p>
<p>The good King, the loving father, had seen his
dear ones for the last time on earth. To save them
from another such trial, he nobly resolved to deprive
himself of the sad consolation of pressing them once
more to his heart, and went to his execution without
a last farewell. His last words, spoken from the
scaffold to the people, were:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I die innocent of all the crimes of which I am
accused. I forgive all those who are the cause of
my death, and pray God that the blood you are
about to shed may assure the happiness of France.
And you, unhappy people....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>The rest was drowned in the roll of drums. His
noble head fell&mdash;the head of a martyr, the head of
one of the best and most merciful kings who ever
ruled in France.<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">Chapter IV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Separation from his Mother</span></h2>
<p>After the sad parting, the Queen had
scarcely strength enough left to undress
her children, and as soon as they were
asleep she flung herself, dressed, upon her
bed, where she passed the night shivering with cold
and trembling with apprehension. The Princess
and Madame &Eacute;lisabeth slept in the same room on
a mattress.</p>
<p>The next morning the royal family arose before
daybreak, waiting for a last sight of him whom,
alas! they were never to see again. In all quarters
of Paris the drums were beating, and the noise penetrated
even into the Tower. At a quarter-past six
the door opened, and some one came in to get a
book, which was wanted for the mass about to be
read to the King. The anxious women regarded
this trifling occurrence as a hopeful sign, and expected
a speedy summons to the promised interview.
But they were soon undeceived. Each moment
seemed an hour, and still the time slipped by without
bringing the fulfilment of their last sorrowful
hope.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>Suddenly a louder roll of drums announced the
moment of the King&rsquo;s departure. No words can
describe the scene that followed. The heart-broken
women, with tears and sobs, made fruitless attempts
to excite the compassion of their pitiless jailers.
The little Prince sprang from his mother&rsquo;s arms,
and, beside himself with grief and terror, ran from
one to another of the guards, clasping their knees,
pressing their hands, and crying wildly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go, messieurs! Let me go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you wish to go?&rdquo; they asked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To my father! I will speak to the people&mdash;I
will beg them not to kill my papa! In the name
of God, messieurs, let me go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guards were deaf to his childish appeals;
fear for their own heads compelled them to be, but
history does not tell us that they were inhuman
enough to jeer at the child or make sport of his
innocent prayer for his father&rsquo;s life. Even harder
hearts must have been touched by the sight of such
sorrow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>About ten o&rsquo;clock the Queen wished the children
to have some breakfast; but they could not eat, and
the food was sent away untouched. A moment
later cries and yells were heard, mingled with the
discharge of firearms. Madame &Eacute;lisabeth raised
her eyes to heaven, and, carried away by the bitterness
of her grief, exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the monsters! They are glad!...&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these words the Princess Marie Th&eacute;r&egrave;se
uttered a piercing scream; the little Dauphin burst
into tears; while the Queen, with drooping head
and staring eyes, seemed sunk in a stupor almost
like death. The shouts of a crier in the street soon
informed them yet more plainly that all was over.</p>
<p>For the rest of the day, the poor little Prince
hardly stirred from his mother&rsquo;s side. He kissed
her hands, often wet with his tears, and overwhelmed
her with sweet childish caresses, which he
seemed to feel would comfort her more than words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! the tears of an innocent child, they may
never cease to flow!&rdquo; said the Queen, bitterly.
&ldquo;Death is harder for those who survive than for
the ones who are gone!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>During the afternoon she asked permission to see
Cl&eacute;ry, who had remained with his royal master in
the Tower till the last moment. She felt that she
must hear the last words and farewells of her martyred
husband and treasure them as a precious
legacy, and for more than an hour the faithful valet
was with her, both absorbed in sorrowful discourse.</p>
<p>The long day passed in tears and wretchedness,
and night brought no respite. The prisoners had
been placed in charge of two jailers, a married
couple named Tison, coarse creatures, from whose
intrusions they were never free. Thus the inflexible
hate of an infuriated populace pursued them
even in the sanctity of their grief.</p>
<p>It was two o&rsquo;clock at night, and more than an
hour since the tearfully ended prayers had announced
the time for rest; but rest was still far from
the three unhappy women. In obedience to the
Queen&rsquo;s wishes, the Princess Marie Th&eacute;r&egrave;se had indeed
gone to bed, but she could not close her eyes.
Her royal mother and her aunt, who were sitting near
the bed of the Dauphin, talked of their sorrow and
wept together in uncontrollable anguish. The
sleeping child smiled, and there was such an expression
of angelic sweetness and purity on his innocent
face that the Queen could not refrain from
saying sadly:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;He is now just as old as his brother was when
he died at Meudon. Happy are those of our
family who have been the first to go; at least they
have not lived to see the downfall of our house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madame Tison, who had been listening at the
door, heard these words, or at least the sound of
the Queen&rsquo;s voice. Devoid of respect for a sorrow
that must find relief in words or become unbearable,
the heartless woman knocked on the door and
harshly demanded the cause of this nocturnal conversation.
As if this were not enough, her husband
and some municipal guards even opened the door
and attempted to force their way into the room,
when Madame &Eacute;lisabeth, turning her pale face
toward them, said with quiet dignity:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I pray you, allow us at least to weep in peace!&rdquo;</p>
<p>These simple words, spoken in such a tone, disarmed
even these wretches. They drew back in
confusion, and did not venture again to intrude on
the sanctity of so profound a grief. The next
morning the Queen took her son in her arms and
said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My child, we must put our trust in the dear
God!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, mamma,&rdquo; answered the little Prince,
&ldquo;I do trust the dear God, but whenever I fold my
hands and try to pray, the image of my father comes
before my eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sadly and wearily the days passed. Weakened
by sorrow and exhausted by sleepless nights, the
Queen almost succumbed to her troubles, and
seemed to be indifferent whether she lived or died.
Sometimes her companions would find her eyes
fixed on them with such an expression of profound
pity, it almost made them shudder. A deathly
stillness prevailed; they all seemed to be holding
their breaths, save when their grief found vent in
half-smothered sobs or paroxysms of tears. It was
almost a boon to the wretched women when the
Princess Marie Th&eacute;r&egrave;se really fell ill. In the duties
of a mother, Marie Antoinette found some mitigation
of her grief for the loss of her husband. She
spent all her time at her daughter&rsquo;s bedside, and the
care and anxiety afforded her a wholesome distraction
and roused her benumbed faculties. The Princess
soon recovered from her illness, and from that
time the Queen devoted herself wholly to her
children.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>The little Dauphin sang very sweetly, and his
mother found much pleasure in teaching him little
songs, but especially in having him continue the
studies he had begun. Thus absorbed, she even
thanked Heaven for the peace granted her by her
enemies, which enabled her to perform these maternal
tasks. Madame &Eacute;lisabeth was her devoted assistant,
and their love for the children afforded them
some relief from sorrows which were constantly
being sharpened by fresh trials. But even this last
faint semblance of happiness was at last taken from
them.</p>
<p>Some faithful friends of the Queen and the royal
house, brave, noble hearts who gladly risked their
lives in the hope of rescuing the prisoners from the
shameful brutalities of their jailers, had devised a
plan for their escape. Owing to an unlucky combination
of circumstances, the attempt failed, and
the tyrants of the Convention, who then held
despotic sway over wretched France, issued the following
decree:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Committee of Public Safety orders that the
son of Capet shall be separated from his mother
and delivered into the hands of a governor, the
choice of whom shall rest with the General Council
of the Commune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the third of July, 1793, this cruel and infamous
order was put into execution.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>It was almost ten o&rsquo;clock on that evening; the
little Prince was in bed and sleeping peacefully and
soundly, with a smile on his pale but still lovely face.
The bed had no curtains, but his mother had ingeniously
arranged a shawl to keep the light from
falling on his closed eyelids and disturbing his
rest.</p>
<p>The Queen, Madame &Eacute;lisabeth, and the Princess
Marie Th&eacute;r&egrave;se were sitting up somewhat later than
usual, the elder ladies busy with some mending and
the Princess reading aloud to them. She had
finished several chapters from some historical work,
and now had a book of devotions called &ldquo;Passion
Week,&rdquo; which Madame &Eacute;lisabeth had succeeded in
obtaining only a short time before. Whenever the
Princess paused to turn a page, or at the end of a
chapter in the history or of a psalm in the book of
prayers, the Queen would raise her head, let her
work fall in her lap, and gaze lovingly at the sleeping
boy or listen to his quiet breathing. Suddenly
the sound of heavy footsteps was heard on the
stairs. The bolts were drawn with a rattle, the
door opened, and six municipal guards entered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;We come,&rdquo; said one of them roughly to the
terrified Princesses, &ldquo;to inform you that the Committee
of Public Safety has ordered the son of
Capet to be separated from his mother and his
family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Queen started to her feet, struck to the
heart by the suddenness of this blow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take my child away from me?&rdquo; she cried,
white with terror,&mdash;&ldquo;no&mdash;no&mdash;it cannot be
possible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Th&eacute;r&egrave;se stood beside her mother trembling,
while Madame &Eacute;lisabeth, with both hands on
the prayer-book, listened and looked on, paralyzed
with terror and unable to stir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Messieurs,&rdquo; continued the Queen in a tremulous
voice, and struggling to control the ague fit
that shook her from head to foot, &ldquo;it is impossible;
the Council cannot think of such a thing as
to separate me from my son! He is so young, he
is so delicate&mdash;my care is so necessary to him!
No&mdash;no&mdash;it cannot be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the decree of the Committee,&rdquo; replied the
officer harshly, unmoved by the deadly pallor of
the Queen; &ldquo;the Convention has decided on the
measure, and we are sent to carry it into immediate
execution.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can never submit to it!&rdquo; cried the unhappy
mother. &ldquo;In the name of Heaven, I beseech
you, do not demand this cruel sacrifice of
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both her companions joined their entreaties to
hers. All three had instinctively placed themselves
before the child&rsquo;s bed, as if to defend it against the
approach of the officers; they wept, they prayed,
they exhausted themselves in the humblest and
most touching supplications. Such distress might
have softened the hardest heart; but to these pitiless
tools of the villanous Convention, they appealed
in vain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the use of all this outburst?&rdquo; they
demanded at length. &ldquo;Your child is not going to
be killed. You had better give him to us without
any more trouble, or we shall find other means of
getting him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In fact, they began to use force against the desperate
mother. In the struggle, the improvised
bed-curtain was torn down and fell on the head of
the sleeping Prince. He awoke, saw at a glance
what was happening, and flung himself into his
mother&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma, dear mamma!&rdquo; he cried, shaking with
fright, &ldquo;do not leave me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>The Queen clasped him close to her breast, as if
to protect him, and clung with all her strength to
the bedposts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pah! We do not fight with women,&rdquo; said one
of the deputies who had not spoken before. &ldquo;Citizens,
let us call up the guard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not do that!&rdquo; said Madame &Eacute;lisabeth,
&ldquo;in the name of Heaven, do not do that! We
must submit to forcible demands, but grant us at
least time to prepare ourselves. This poor child
needs his sleep, and he will not be able to sleep anywhere
but here. Let him at least spend the night
in this room, and he shall be delivered into your
hands early in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this touching appeal there was no reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Promise me, at least,&rdquo; said the Queen in a hollow
voice, &ldquo;that he shall remain within the walls of
this Tower, and that I shall be permitted to see him
every day, if only at meal times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not obliged to account to you for what
we do,&rdquo; snarled one of the rough fellows, ferociously;
&ldquo;neither is it for you to question the acts of the
country. Just because your child is taken from you,
why should you act like a fool? Are not our sons
marching toward the frontier every day, to have
their heads shot off by the enemy you enticed
there?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I did not entice them there,&rdquo; replied the
Queen; &ldquo;and you see that my son is much too
young to serve his country yet. Some day, God
willing, I hope he will be proud to devote his life
to France.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The threatening manner of the officers showed
the poor mother plainly enough that all her prayers
were useless, and she must yield to her cruel fate.
With trembling hands she dressed the little Prince,
and, although both Princesses assisted her, it took
her longer than ever before. Every garment, before
it was put on the child, was turned in and out,
passed from hand to hand, and wet with bitter tears.
In every possible way they strove to defer the
dreadful moment of parting, but the officers soon
began to lose patience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make haste!&rdquo; they cried. &ldquo;We can wait no
longer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a breaking heart, the Queen submitted.
Summoning all her fortitude, she seated herself on
a chair, laid both her thin white hands on the
shoulders of the unhappy child, and, forcing herself
to be calm, said to him in a solemn, earnest voice:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;My child, we must part. Remember your oath
when I am no longer with you to remind you of it.
Never forget the dear God who has sent you this
trial, nor the dear mother who loves you. Be prudent,
brave, and patient, and your father will look
down from Heaven and bless you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So speaking, she pressed a last kiss on his forehead,
clasped him once more to her tortured heart,
and gave him to his jailers. The poor child sprang
away from them, rushed to his mother again, and
clung desperately to her dress, clasping her knees.
She tried to soothe his distress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must obey, my child, you must!&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I hope you have no more instructions
to give him,&rdquo; added one of the deputies. &ldquo;You
have abused our patience enough already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As it is, you might have saved yourself the
trouble of giving him any,&rdquo; said another, dragging
the Prince forcibly out of the room.</p>
<p>A third, somewhat more humane than the others,
added, &ldquo;You need not have any further anxiety;
the great and generous country will care for him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>Heaven was witness what tears of anguish, what
cries of despair, followed this distressing scene. In
the extremity of her sufferings, the unfortunate
mother writhed upon the bed where her son had
just been sleeping. She had succeeded in maintaining
her courage and a feigned composure in the
presence of the merciless wretches who had robbed
her of her child, but this unnatural strength, this
superhuman exertion, had exhausted all the powers
of her being and almost deprived her of reason.
Never was there a greater despair than that of this
most unhappy Queen and her companions. The
three prisoners gazed at one another in speechless
agony, and could find no words of consolation. The
only comfort of their wretched life was gone. The
little Dauphin had been the one ray of sunlight in
the darkness of their imprisonment, and that now
had been extinguished. What more could follow?
Alas! even worse was yet to come, for the resources
of inhumanity are boundless!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">Chapter V</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Cobbler Simon</span></h2>
<p>Guarded by six deputies and a turnkey,
the young Prince, or rather King,
since he was the only and lawful heir to
the throne, was taken to that part of the
Tower formerly occupied by his father. There a
guardian was awaiting him, a cruel, tyrannical master,
the cobbler Simon. The room was poorly
lighted. After conversing with this man for some
time in an undertone, the deputies gave him some
final instructions and withdrew, and the child found
himself alone with Simon, whose slouching gait,
rough and violent language, and arrogant manner,
easily proclaimed him the future master of the
unfortunate Prince.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>The cobbler Simon was fifty-seven years old, of
more than medium height, powerfully built, with a
swarthy skin and a shock of stiff black hair falling
over his eyebrows. His features were heavy, and
he wore large mustaches. His wife was about the
same age, but very short and stout; she was dark
and ill-favored, like her husband, and usually wore
a cap with red ribbons, and a blue apron. This
worthy pair were given absolute control over the
Dauphin, the descendant of so many kings, torn
from his royal mother&rsquo;s arms to be delivered into
such hands as these! The very refinement of
cruelty could scarcely have conceived a greater
infamy! The poor child, confused and bewildered
by having been awakened so suddenly from a sound
sleep, remained for hours sitting on a stool in the
farthest corner of the room and weeping pitifully.
Simon plied him with rude questions, plentifully
sprinkled with curses and blasphemies, as he smoked
his pipe, but only succeeded in extracting short
answers from his victim.</p>
<p>For the first two or three days the little Prince
was in such despair at being parted from his mother
that he could swallow nothing but a few mouthfuls
of broth. Soon, however, he began to rebel inwardly;
gleams of indignation shone through his
tears, and his anger broke forth at last in passionate
words:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>&ldquo;I want to know,&rdquo; he cried imperiously to the
municipal officers who were visiting Simon, &ldquo;what
law gives you the right to take me from my mother
and keep me shut up here? Show me this law! I
will see it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officers were amazed at this child of nine
years, who dared to question their power and address
them in such a kingly tone. But their worthy
comrade came to their aid. He harshly ordered
his charge to be silent, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue, Capet! you are only a
chatterer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little prisoner&rsquo;s sad and longing gaze was
continually fixed upon the door, although he knew
he could never pass its threshold without permission
from his jailers. He often wept, but seemed at last
to resign himself to his fate, and mutely obeyed the
commands of his tormentors. He would not speak,
however.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oho, little Capet!&rdquo; said the cobbler to him
one day; &ldquo;so you are dumb! Well, I am going
to teach you to talk, to sing the &lsquo;Carmagnole,&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a> and
shout &lsquo;Vive la Republique!&rsquo; Oh, yes, you are
dumb, are you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>&ldquo;If I said all I thought,&rdquo; returned the poor child,
with a touch of his old spirit, &ldquo;you would call me
mad. I am silent because I am afraid of saying
too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho! so Monsieur Capet has much to say!&rdquo;
shouted the cobbler with a malicious laugh. &ldquo;That
sounds very aristocratic, but it won&rsquo;t do with me, do
you hear? You are still young, and some allowance
should be made for you on that account; but I am
your master, and cannot allow such ignorance. I
must teach you to understand progress and the new
ideas. So, look here! I am going to give you a
jews-harp. Your she-wolf of a mother and your
dog of an aunt play the piano, you must learn the
jews-harp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A gleam of anger flashed in the boy&rsquo;s beautiful
blue eyes, and he refused to take the jews-harp,
declaring that he never would play on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never?&rdquo; cried the cobbler, furiously. &ldquo;Never?
Play on it this moment!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child persisted in his determination, and the
cobbler&mdash;the pen almost refuses to write it&mdash;the
cobbler seized the defenceless child and beat him
most cruelly, but without being able to conquer his
will.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>&ldquo;You can punish me if I do wrong,&rdquo; cried the
poor little Prince, &ldquo;but you must not strike me; do
you understand? For you are stronger than I
am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am here to command you, you beast!&rdquo; roared
the cobbler. &ldquo;I can do what I like! Long live
Liberty and Equality!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Sunday, the 17th of July, 1793, a report
spread through Paris that the Dauphin had been
carried off. In order to refute this rumor, which
had already begun to create disturbances among the
lower classes, a deputation was sent to the Temple
by the Committee of Public Safety, with orders that
the son of the tyrant should be brought down into
the garden where he might be seen. The cobbler
obeyed, and unceremoniously demanded of the deputies
what the real intentions of the Committee
were in regard to little Capet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have they decided to do with the young
wolf? He has been taught to be insolent, and I
will see that he is tamed. If he rebels, so much the
worse for him, I warrant you! But what is to be
done with him in the end? Send him out of the
country? No! Kill him? No! Poison him?
No! Well, what then?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;We must get rid of him!&rdquo; was the significant
reply.</p>
<p>Such, indeed, was the real purpose of the inhuman
leaders of the Revolution. They did not want to
put the unfortunate Prince to death, they only wished
to get rid of him; that is to say, to torture him to
death by slow degrees, without anyone being able
to say that he had been poisoned, strangled, hanged,
or beheaded!</p>
<p>As soon as the Dauphin found himself in the
garden, he began to call to his mother as loudly as
he could. Some of the guards tried to quiet him;
but he answered indignantly, pointing to Simon and
the deputies:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will not, they cannot, show me the
law that orders me to be separated from my
mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Astonished at his firmness and moved by his
childish affection, one of the guards asked the cobbler
whether no one could help the little fellow; but
Simon replied sharply:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;The young wolf does not submit to the muzzle
easily; he might know the law as well as you do,
but he is always asking for the reasons of things&mdash;as
if people were obliged to give him reasons! Now,
Capet, keep still, or I will show the citizens how I
beat you when you deserve it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor little prisoner turned to the deputies
as if to appeal to their compassion, but they coldly
turned their backs on him. <i>He was to be got rid of!</i>
How could this be possible if he were left to the
tender care of his mother?</p>
<p>Henceforth Simon&rsquo;s cruelties toward his victim
were redoubled. He understood at last what was
expected of him, and wished to do credit to his task.
The youth, the innocence, the indescribable charm
of the little Prince, did not in the least diminish the
ferocity of his jailer. On the contrary, it seemed
as though the child&rsquo;s delicate face, his clear eyes, his
slender little hands, the nobility of his demeanor,
only served to inflame the brutal passions of Simon
and his wife. They felt the Prince&rsquo;s refinement and
delicacy, in contrast with their own uncouthness, as
a personal affront; and their jealous rage, their implacable
hatred, made them take a savage pleasure
in attempting to degrade their charge to their own
level and extinguishing in this scion of a royal house
all recollection of his illustrious family and of his
early education.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>Still another circumstance added to Simon&rsquo;s abuse
of the Prince. Marat,<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a> that bloody and ferocious
hyena of the Revolution, died at last by the knife
of Charlotte Corday. Marat had been a patron of
Simon&rsquo;s, and was largely responsible for the appointment
of the cobbler as the Dauphin&rsquo;s keeper&mdash;a position
which carried with it a considerable income&mdash;and
his sudden death threw Simon into a sort of
frenzy. When he heard the news, he deserted his
prisoner for the first time, and returned in a state of
excitement and irritation that relieved itself in abuse
and blasphemy. He drank quantities of wine and
brandy, and then, inflamed with the liquor, his brain
on fire, he dragged his wife and the Prince up to
the platform of the Tower, where he smoked his
pipe and tried to catch an echo of the far-away
lamentations for his friend Marat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you hear that noise down there, Capet?&rdquo;
he shouted to the Prince. &ldquo;It is the voice of the
people, lamenting the loss of their friend. You
wear black clothes for your father; I was going
to make you take them off to-morrow, but now you
shall wear them still longer. Capet shall put on
mourning for Marat! But, accursed one, you do
not seem much grieved about it! Perhaps you are
glad that he is dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words, furious with rage, he shook
the boy, threatened him with his fist, and pushed
him violently away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know the man who is dead,&rdquo; returned
the child, &ldquo;and you should not say that I am
glad. We never wish for the death of anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, <i>we</i>? &lsquo;<i>We</i> wish?&rsquo; <i>We?</i>&rdquo; roared the
cobbler. &ldquo;Are you presuming to say <i>we</i>, like
those tyrants, your forefathers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; answered the Prince, &ldquo;I say <i>we</i>, in
the plural, meaning myself and my family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somewhat appeased by this apology, the cobbler
strode up and down, puffing great clouds of smoke
from his mouth and laughing to himself as he
repeated: &ldquo;Capet shall put on mourning for
Marat!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>Marat was buried on the following morning, and
Simon&rsquo;s resentment at not being able to attend the
funeral ceremonies made him furious. All day
long he paced the floor of his room like a caged
tiger, sparing the innocent Prince neither blows nor
curses.</p>
<p>Some days later, news came of a crushing defeat of
the Republican army at Saumur,<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a> and again the poor
child had to suffer from his master&rsquo;s rage and spite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is your friends who are doing this!&rdquo; shouted
Simon to him.</p>
<p>In vain the little Prince cried, &ldquo;Indeed it is not
my fault!&rdquo; The infamous wretch furiously rushed
at him, and shook him with the ferocity of a maddened
beast. The child bore it all in silence;
great tears rolled down his cheeks, but he allowed
no cry of pain to escape him, for fear his mother
might hear it and be distressed about him. This
fear gave him strength, and enabled him to bear
his sufferings with the courage of a hero. Joy
had long since been banished from his heart, the
roses of health from his cheeks, but they had
not succeeded yet in extinguishing his love of truth
and purity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>In accordance with the orders he had received,
Simon allowed his prisoner to go down into the
garden every day, and sometimes took him with
him when he went up on the roof of the Tower to
breathe the air and smoke his pipe undisturbed.
The boy followed him with hanging head, like a
whipped dog; he never ventured to raise his eyes
to his master&rsquo;s face, knowing he should meet only
hatred and abuse.</p>
<p>Naturally there was no further mention of any
kind of instruction for the Prince. Simon made
him listen to revolutionary or so-called patriotic
songs, and filled his ears with the vilest oaths and
blasphemies; but he did not think it necessary to
occupy young Capet&rsquo;s time otherwise. He forced
the child to wait on him and perform the most
menial duties; he took away his suit of mourning,
and gave him instead a coat of orange-colored cloth,
with breeches of the same color, and a red cap, which
was the notorious uniform of the Jacobins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I allow you to take off black for Marat,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;at least you shall wear his livery and honor
his memory in that way!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>The Prince put on the clothes without protest,
but nothing could induce him to wear the Jacobin
cap; and Simon was powerless, even by the cruellest
treatment, to overcome his resistance. He had
become the slave of his jailers, he had submitted to
a thousand insults and indignities, but he would not
allow the badge of his father&rsquo;s murderers to be placed
upon his head. Weary with his efforts, the cobbler
finally desisted from the attempt, at the intercession
of his wife. To tell the truth, this was not the first
time this woman had taken the part of the unfortunate
child, for she, indeed, had good reason to be
satisfied with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is an amiable being, and a nice child,&rdquo; she
remarked one day to another woman. &ldquo;He cleans
and polishes my shoes, and makes the fire for me
when I get up,&rdquo; for these were also his duties
now. Alas! what a change from the days when
every morning he had brought his adored mother a
nosegay from his garden, picked and arranged with
his own hands! Now, the drudge of a shoemaker&rsquo;s
wife&mdash;poor, lovely, high-born little Prince!</p>
<p>A systematic effort was made to debase the child
in every way, morally and physically; no pains were
spared to vitiate his pure innocent mind and make
him familiar with the most revolting infamies.
Madame Simon cut off his beautiful hair for no
other reason than because it had been his mother&rsquo;s
delight. As it happened, some guards and deputies
witnessed the act, and one of them, a good-natured
fellow named Meunier, cried out:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what have you slashed off all his pretty
hair for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; retorted Madame Simon. &ldquo;Why,
don&rsquo;t you see, citizen, we were playing the part of
dethroned King, here!&rdquo; And all, with the exception
of Meunier, burst into shouts of laughter over
the shorn lamb, who bent his poor little disfigured
head upon his breast in mute despair. Not content
with this outrage, that same evening the brutal
wretches forced the child to drink large quantities
of wine, which he detested; and when they had succeeded
in making him drunk, so that he did not
know what he was doing, Simon put the red cap on
his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>&ldquo;At last I see you a Jacobin!&rdquo; cried the villain,
triumphantly, as the Revolutionary emblem nodded
on the brow of the unhappy descendant of Louis
the Fourteenth, the proudest King of Christendom!
They had broken the child&rsquo;s noble pride at last&mdash;one
shudders to think by what terrible means;
and from this time a few blows or curses sufficed
to make him put on the new head-covering. Thus
far the wretched child&rsquo;s unhappy fate had remained
unknown to his mother, although she had never
ceased to implore the guards or deputies for news
of him. They all assured her that she need not be
uneasy about her son&mdash;that he was in good hands
and well cared for; but all these protestations failed
to soothe her maternal anxiety and but too well-founded
distrust.</p>
<p>At last, on the thirteenth of July, through the
assistance of Tison, who, at first a bitter enemy,
had since changed and become friendly to her, she
succeeded in obtaining a sight of her poor little son.
But alas! this happiness, so long yearned for, so
besought from Heaven, was granted her only to
her sorrow. The little Prince indeed passed before
the eyes of his mother, who bent her anxious,
searching gaze upon him. He had laid aside the
mourning for his father; the red cap was on his
head, his brutal jailer beside him. Unluckily,
moreover, just at that moment Simon fell into
one of the outbursts of fury that usually vented
themselves upon his wretched charge. The poor
Queen, struck by this terrible sight as if by lightning,
grasped her sister-in-law for support, and both
quickly drew the Princess Marie Th&eacute;r&egrave;se away
from their place of concealment (whither she had
hastened for a glimpse of her brother), at the same
time reassuring themselves by a glance that she had
seen nothing and remained in blissful ignorance of
the Dauphin&rsquo;s fate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is useless to wait any longer,&rdquo; said the Queen;
&ldquo;he will not come now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a few moments, her tears began to flow;
she turned away to hide them, and came back again,
hoping for another sight of her son. A little later
she did see him again. He passed by in silence,
with bowed head; his tyrant was no longer cursing
him. She heard no words, but this silence was
almost as terrible to her as Simon&rsquo;s invectives.
Mute and motionless, she remained as if rooted to
the spot till Tison came for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, God!&rdquo; she cried bitterly to him, &ldquo;you
have been deceiving me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, madame,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;I merely did not
tell you everything, so you would not be troubled.
But now that you know all, in the future I will
conceal nothing from you that I may chance to
discover.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>The knowledge of the pitiable condition of her
son reduced the Queen to the apathy of despair, and
she would sit for hours in silent misery. To know
that her child was suffering and not be able to tend
or care for him, to know that he was unhappy and
not be able to comfort him, to know that he was in
danger and not be able to protect him&mdash;what tortures
could compare with the martyrdom of this poor
mother? It turned her beautiful dark hair as white
as snow, and made her indifferent to her own fate.
The Convention had issued a decree that the Queen
should be removed from the Temple to the Conciergerie,
and on the second of August, at two o&rsquo;clock
in the morning, the Princesses were roused from
their sleep to hear this order. The Queen listened
quietly and without a word as it was read to them,
then rose immediately and made her preparations
to follow the officers, who first searched her
roughly, and even took everything out of her pockets.
Before she went, she embraced her daughter
and sister-in-law, and exhorted them to be brave
and steadfast. As she passed through the low
doorway, she forgot to stoop, and struck her head a
sharp blow against it. One of the men asked her
if she was hurt, and she replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing can hurt me now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>But ah! with what feelings must she have left
that Tower! With what lingering glances at the
door of the room where the Dauphin was confined!
She knew she was leaving never to return; knew
that never again should she clasp her child to her
breast; knew that he was in the clutches of a tiger.
Poor ill-fated, unhappy Queen and mother!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Simon continued by every vile means
in his power to maltreat the child committed to his
guardianship. On the seventh of August, Madame
Simon went to the theatre to see a low play performed,
entitled &ldquo;Brutus,&rdquo; and returned full of
enthusiasm. She described the piece, the plot of
which was directed against royalty, and Simon listened
eagerly and attentively. Suddenly he perceived
that the little Prince had turned away his
head, as if to avoid hearing it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You accursed young wolf,&rdquo; he cried furiously,
&ldquo;so you do not want to listen to the citoyenne&mdash;to
be improved and enlightened! You would like
to remain a blockhead and the son of a tyrant!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone has relatives that he should honor,&rdquo;
replied the boy with angelic calmness and filial
affection.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>This very calmness and composure only seemed
to enrage Simon the more. He could not forgive
the child for honoring his father and mother, and,
seizing him roughly, he threw him across the room
and down to the floor, with a volley of oaths and
abusive epithets. Nor was this the worst of which
the monster was guilty. If a rising occurred anywhere
in France, against the Revolution and its
crimes, he vented his rage and spite upon his victim.
On the sixth of August, Montbrison rose in arms,
with the cry, &ldquo;God save King Louis the Seventeenth!&rdquo;
Three or four days later the news reached
the Temple, and Simon immediately pounced upon
the Prince.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, madame,&rdquo; said he, jeeringly, &ldquo;allow me
to present to you the King of Montbrison, and&rdquo;&mdash;he
continued, taking off the boy&rsquo;s Jacobin cap&mdash;&ldquo;I
will anoint him at once and burn incense to
him!&rdquo; Whereupon he rubbed the poor child&rsquo;s
head and ears roughly with his hard hands, blew
tobacco smoke from his pipe into his face, and
finally flung him over to his wife, that she in her turn
might do homage to &ldquo;His Majesty.&rdquo; On the
tenth of August, the Convention gave a <i>f&ecirc;te</i> for the
people, and Simon awakened the Prince from his
morning sleep and commanded him to shout, &ldquo;Long
live the Republic!&rdquo; The child did not seem to
understand at first; he arose, and began to put on
his clothes in silence, when Simon, who was standing
before him with folded arms, repeated imperiously:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;Make haste, Capet! This is a great day; you
must shout &lsquo;Vive la Republique!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy made no answer, but went on with his
dressing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! Who am I talking to here?&rdquo; cried the
cobbler, furiously. &ldquo;Accursed King of Montbrison,
will you shout &lsquo;Vive la Republique!&rsquo; quickly&mdash;or&mdash;&rdquo;
and he made a significant gesture with his
clenched fist.</p>
<p>The Prince raised his head with a resolute expression,
and, looking full at his tormentor, replied
in a clear, firm voice: &ldquo;You may do what you
choose with me, but I will never cry, &lsquo;Vive la
Republique!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke so proudly and nobly that even this
hardened villain gave way before him, and for once
did not venture to do him any violence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, good!&rdquo; said Simon with a sneer, to cover
his discomfiture; &ldquo;I will see that your behavior is
made known.&rdquo; And indeed he did repeat the
whole incident to everyone in the Temple; but no
one blamed the Prince, and some even praised him
for his strength of character.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>The next morning the cobbler seemed to have
repented of his weakness. He procured an account
of the <i>f&ecirc;te</i> of the preceding day, and forced the boy
to stand and listen while he read it aloud. The
Prince obeyed; but at one part, which contained a
gross insult to his father, he could no longer control
his rebellious feelings, and retired to one of the
window recesses to hide his face and his tears.
Simon hurried after him, dragged him roughly back
by the hair to the table, and ordered him, under
pain of a beating, to stand there and listen quietly
and attentively. Then he resumed his reading, and
laid particular emphasis on the words: &ldquo;Let us
swear to defend the Constitution unto death; the
Republic shall live forever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you hear that, Capet?&rdquo; he shouted; &ldquo;the
Republic shall live forever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child made no reply, and did not even raise
his head; his face was hidden in his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cursed young wolf!&rdquo; roared Simon,
choking with passion, &ldquo;yesterday you would not
shout &lsquo;Vive la Republique!&rsquo; but you see now,
blockhead, that the Republic shall live forever!
You <i>shall</i> say with us, &lsquo;The Republic shall live
forever!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>As he spoke, he seized the Dauphin by both
shoulders and shook him with all his strength, as
if to force the words from his mouth. After exhausting
his fury, the cobbler paced up and down
the floor for some time, then stopped beside the
bed of the weeping child and said gruffly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is your own fault, fool; you well deserved
your treatment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him alone, Simon,&rdquo; said his wife; &ldquo;he is
blind, the little one. He was brought up on lies
and deception, and knows no better.&rdquo; And, somewhat
disconcerted, the cobbler turned away.</p>
<p>Not long after this, the police scattered through
the streets of the city low songs and scurrilous
rhymes against the &ldquo;Austrian she-wolf,&rdquo; as the unfortunate
Marie Antoinette was called, and Simon
procured some of these sheets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Capet,&rdquo; said he one day to the little Prince,
holding out to him some abominable verses about his
mother, &ldquo;here is a new song you must sing for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy glanced at the song, and threw it indignantly
on the table. Simon immediately flew into
a rage, and said threateningly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I said you should sing, and you shall
sing!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;I will never sing such a song as that!&rdquo; replied
the boy, with a firm determination against which the
cobbler&rsquo;s rage was powerless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you, I will strike you dead if you do not
sing!&rdquo; he shouted, seizing an iron grating from the
chimney-place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; retorted the Prince, and the furious
brute actually hurled the heavy iron at the boy&rsquo;s
head, and would certainly have killed him if he had
not been quick enough to dodge the missile.</p>
<p>Scenes like this were of daily occurrence in the
cruel prison of the Temple. Simon left nothing
undone to accomplish his terrible purpose and <i>rid
the Convention</i> of the unfortunate child. He kept
his prisoner on an irregular diet, forcing him one
day to eat and drink to excess, and the next leaving
him to suffer from hunger. With diabolical calculation,
he did everything possible to undermine the
health of the Dauphin, and succeeded only too well.
He gradually sickened, and an attack of fever helped
to reduce his strength. He slowly recovered, it is
true; but his old vigor of mind and body never
returned. They took advantage of his illness to
make him sign a deposition against his mother; and
this false statement, extorted from him while he was
too weak to resist, was used by the bloodthirsty
Convention to bring the Queen&rsquo;s head to the scaffold.
The rising in La Vend&eacute;e also brought fresh abuse
upon the Prince. The Vendeans had proclaimed
him King, and Simon made merry, with some of his
friends who were visiting him, over the &ldquo;King of
La Vend&eacute;e.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;For all that,&rdquo; said one of them, &ldquo;there are signs
of change in the air, and it would be curious if this
monkey should be a King sometime!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least, citizen,&rdquo; returned Simon, &ldquo;he will
never be King of Paris&mdash;trust me for that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince, crouching at the foot of his bed, had
been obliged to overhear all this, with other cruel
and bloodthirsty jests about the son of &ldquo;Louis the
Shortened.&rdquo; After the guests had finally departed,
Simon remained some time longer in the room,
quarrelling with his wife, who did not attempt to conceal
her fears for the future. The little Prince had
not dared to leave his place, and heard Simon say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the Vendeans should ever advance as far as
Paris, I will throttle the young wolf before I will
give him up to them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>He kept as still as he could, fearing that the
least sound or movement would bring down on
his head the storm that seemed ready to burst.
Suddenly Simon came up to him, seized him by
the ear, and led him to the table in the middle of
the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Capet,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if the Vendeans should set
you free, what would you do with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would forgive you,&rdquo; replied the child, calmly.
Such an answer might have softened the hardest
heart, but it only increased the cobbler&rsquo;s hatred for
him. Poor helpless, forsaken child! They had
robbed him of his mother, too, now, for the
Queen had been dragged to the guillotine on the
sixteenth of October, though, happily, of this he
knew nothing.<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>The poor little Prince had become sadly changed.
The face that had been so fresh and smiling was
deeply lined, and bore the marks of sorrow and
suffering; the once clear, rosy complexion had grown
dull and sallow; his limbs looked too long and thin
for his size, and his back was bent a little, as if with
the weight of his trouble. Since he had found that
all his actions, and even his words, brought abuse
or derision upon him he remained silent, scarcely daring
to answer the simplest question with &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or
&ldquo;no.&rdquo; He was like a deaf-mute, and at last his
mind began to be confused. He scarcely seemed to
remember his past life or realize his present situation.
Now that he no longer afforded Simon any excuse
for beating him, that foul wretch found himself compelled
to devise other means of venting his brutality
and hastening the end of his victim.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>Yet the Dauphin was not entirely destitute of
friends and sympathizers. One of the turnkeys,
named Gourlet, and Meunier, a servant in the Temple,
ventured upon the dangerous attempt to provide
him with a little diversion. The child had
expressed a desire for some birds, and Meunier immediately
exerted himself to obtain some canaries.
He went to several families whose devotion to the
royal house was known to him, and, on his stating
his purpose, they hastened to place their birds at his
disposal. He returned to the Temple with ten or
twelve canaries, all of which were well tamed and
trained. Their gay chirping and flutterings brought
life and cheerfulness into the gloomy prison, and,
full of delight, the little Prince caught them one
after another, and kissed them. There was one of
the winged band he noticed particularly. It was
tamer and more affectionate than all the rest, and
would come flying to him at the softest call, to perch
on his outstretched finger, seeming to enjoy the
caresses he bestowed on it. For this bird, the little
Prince soon conceived an especial affection; he spent
much time with it, fed it millet seed from his hand
or his mouth, and, in order to be able to distinguish
it more readily from the others, he fastened a little
red ribbon on one of its feet. Whenever he called,
the tiny creature would come to him instantly, alight
first on his head, then hop to his shoulder, and
finally settle itself upon his finger.</p>
<p>These playmates made the poor little prisoner
very happy; but it was too pleasant, too sweet, to
last long. On the nineteenth of December a visit of
inspection was made, and when the officers entered,
the Prince&rsquo;s yellow favorite was trilling its clear,
shrill notes in a burst of song.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this?&rdquo; cried one of
the deputies, roughly. &ldquo;The bird there is wearing
a red ribbon like an order! That savors too much
of aristocracy, and signifies a distinction that no
good republican should tolerate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words he seized the poor little songster,
tore the ribbon from its foot, and hurled it
against the wall. Happily, the bird used its
wings, and saved itself from being killed; it fell
to the floor indeed, but soon started up again and
mingled with its companions, uttering soft, plaintive
notes.</p>
<p>The little Prince, horror-stricken, could not take
his eyes from his feathered friend. He had not
been able to repress a cry at the cruel act, but
did not dare to show any concern or sympathy,
for fear of making matters worse. Poor child! as
a result of this unlucky visit, all the birds that had
afforded him so much innocent pleasure were ruthlessly
taken away from him. It had been indeed
too pleasant to last! Simon&rsquo;s fear that he might
be blamed for allowing the creatures in the prison
increased his resentment against the Dauphin, and
he nursed his wrath until he could find an outlet
for it. The opportunity soon came.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>The next day he happened to take a foot-bath,
and, as it was very agreeable to him to be waited
on by a King&rsquo;s son, he ordered the boy to warm
the linen for drying his feet. Trembling with fear
of his brutal jailer, the poor child obeyed with
more haste than dexterity, and in his agitation
dropped a towel into the fire. The cobbler&rsquo;s feet
were in the water, and, foaming with rage at his
inability to reach the child, he hurled the most
frightful imprecations at him. After a few moments,
the Dauphin, thinking his master&rsquo;s fury had passed,
knelt down to dry Simon&rsquo;s feet, and the monster
profited by this opportunity to give him a kick
that sent him half across the room and stretched
him on the floor. As if stunned by the shock, the
poor child lay there motionless; but, not content
with this, the cobbler beat and kicked him, overwhelming
him at the same time with the vilest
epithets until his breath gave out. Then, seeing that
his victim was still conscious and able to move, he
ordered him to stand up; and the poor little Prince
was obliged to rise and drag himself into a corner,
where he was suffered to remain, weeping piteously.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic3">

<p class="caption"><i>The Cobbler and his little victim</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>The jailer grew more vindictive every day, his
passions more malignant; and his temper was not
improved when his wife became so dangerously ill
that the services of a physician were required. A
surgeon named Nautin, a worthy, respectable man,
was called in, prescribed a remedy, and promised to
come again the next day. As he was leaving, he
passed through the room where Simon sat with
his charge and some of the municipal officers. The
boy had refused to sing a licentious song as Simon
had ordered, and, just as the surgeon entered, the
cobbler flung himself upon the child, lifted him up
by the hair and shook him, shouting furiously:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accursed viper! I have a mind to dash you to
pieces against the wall!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor hastened to the spot and snatched
the Dauphin from Simon&rsquo;s grasp, crying angrily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Villain, what are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taken aback by this interference, Simon recoiled
without a word, and for the time being did
not venture to maltreat the Prince any further.
On the following day the surgeon again visited
his patient, and was greatly surprised and touched
when suddenly, as he was passing through the
room where the Dauphin was confined, the little
prisoner seized his hand and offered him two pears
which he had saved from his own meal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;Take them, please, dear sir,&rdquo; he said in his
touching voice; &ldquo;yesterday you showed that you
have an interest in me. I thank you for it, but
have no way of proving my gratitude. Will you
not take these pears, then? It will make me very
happy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man pressed the child&rsquo;s hand kindly, but
did not speak. He accepted the present, and a tear
that rolled down his cheek betrayed the emotion
he could not find words to express.</p>
<p>So noble was the nature of this royal child that
even the terrible treatment he had received had not
entirely destroyed his sensibilities&mdash;at the slightest
touch of kindness or sympathy they sprang to life
again. Never had he forgotten his mother&rsquo;s admonitions.
Sometimes he even recalled them in
his dreams; and once it happened that Simon overheard
him when, in his sleep, he knelt with folded
hands and prayed fervently to God. Unmoved by
this touching sight, the cobbler awakened his wife to
look at the strange dreamer; then, seizing a pitcher
of water, he suddenly dashed it over the little bowed
head, regardless of the danger that the shock of
such an ice-cold shower-bath on a January night
might kill the child. Instantly seized with a chill,
the Prince threw himself back on his bed without
uttering a sound. But the dampness of his couch
allowed him no rest. He got up again and sought
refuge on the floor with his pillow&mdash;the only part
of his bed that had escaped the deluge. As he
crouched there, his teeth chattering with cold,
Simon sprang up again in spite of his wife&rsquo;s efforts
to detain him, grasped the child with both hands,
and shook him violently, crying:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>&ldquo;I will teach you to get up in the night to recite
your paternosters, like a Trappist!&rdquo; Then as if
in a frenzy he rushed at the boy with such a malignant
expression upon his cruel face that the poor
little Prince caught at the arms of his ferocious
jailer and cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what have I done that you should want to
murder me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murder you! As if that was what I wanted!
Don&rsquo;t you know that, if I wished to murder you,
I could take you by the throat and stop your noise
in no time?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>So speaking, he flung the boy roughly back into
his bed, which had been turned into a veritable
pond. Without a word, he sank down on his
wretched cot, shivering with cold and terror, while
the cobbler retired to his own rest filled with savage
satisfaction. After this dreadful night the poor little
Dauphin fell into a state of utter despair and apathy.
Even his tearful glances no longer appealed to his
brutal keeper. His eyes were always fixed on the
floor. The last remnants of his courage were gone;
he had finally succumbed to his fate.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the terrible Simon was not to enjoy
the triumph of seeing his victim expire at his feet.
The municipal council had decreed that for the
future the prisoner was to be guarded by four of
its members, who were to serve as deputies, and on
the nineteenth of January, 1794, Simon and his wife
were removed from the Temple. The parting words
of the cobbler to the innocent child he had tortured
so barbarously were quite in keeping with his character.
His wife had said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Capet, I do not know whether I shall ever
see you again!&rdquo; And Simon added: &ldquo;Oh! he
is not crushed yet; but he will never get out of
this prison&mdash;not if all the saints of heaven moved
in his behalf!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>A last blow accompanied these words, which the
poor little Prince, who stood before him with downcast
eyes, received meekly and apathetically, without
even a glance at his departing jailer. But Simon
did not escape the vengeance of Heaven. The
cruel cobbler perished on the scaffold on the twenty-eighth
of July, 1794, together with Robespierre and
other monsters of the Revolution.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The End of Sorrows</span></h2>
<p>The removal of Simon released the Dauphin
from actual physical abuse, but on
the whole there was not much change
for the better in his situation. The
leaders of the Revolution felt no pity for the royal
child; and instead of appointing a successor to the
cobbler, they doomed him to solitary confinement.
The door of communication between his prison and
the anteroom was securely fastened with nails and
screws, and crossed from top to bottom with iron
bars. Three or four feet from the floor there was
a small opening over a little shelf, covered by a
movable iron grating, which was secured by a padlock.
Through this opening or wicket little Capet
was supplied with food and water, and when he had
eaten he replaced the empty vessels on the shelf.
They allowed him neither light nor fire. His
room was heated only by the flue from a stove in
the antechamber, and lighted only by a lamp which
hung opposite the wicket. Here the poor child
spent the terrible days and nights, his only way of
reckoning time; for years, months, weeks, days,
were all one in his confused brain. Time, like a
stagnant pool, had ceased to flow for him. There
was nothing but suffering to mark the hours, hence
they were indistinguishable.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>We will pass quickly over this period&mdash;one
long monotonous round of misery and wretchedness,
that lasted without intermission for more than six
months. During all that time the air of heaven
did not once penetrate to this barred cell, and only
a faint glimmer of daylight pierced the grating and
the close, heavy shutters. The little prisoner never
saw the guards who thrust his scanty meals to him
through the wicket; he heard no sound but the
creaking of bolts and a harsh voice, which at the
close of day ordered him to go to bed, since there
was no light for him. The solitude and loneliness
lay upon his spirit like a leaden weight. Without
work, without play, without diversion or occupation
of any kind, how endless must the days have been!
And then the night and darkness, with its vague
phantoms, its indefinable terrors, chilling the child&rsquo;s
blood with fear!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>Many such days and nights passed, but no word,
no sound of complaint, escaped from the dark cell.
The wicket was opened every day, but the little
Prince never sought for pity or compassion. He
had given up all hope of human sympathy, and
trusted only to the mercy of God; hoped only for
a speedy death and for everlasting peace beyond.</p>
<p>The deputies, whose duty it was to guard the
Dauphin, were cruel and unfeeling&mdash;if not naturally
so, then because they feared to be otherwise. At
nightfall they would go up to the den of the
&ldquo;young wolf&rdquo; to assure themselves that he was
alive and had not escaped. If he did not answer
their harsh summons at once, they would open the
wicket with a great clattering and shout:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Capet, Capet! Are you asleep? Where are
you? Get up, viper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child, so rudely aroused, would drag himself
with trembling limbs from his wretched bed to the
grating, his feet colder than the damp floor on which
he trod, to answer gently:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here I am!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come nearer, then, so we can see you!&rdquo;
they would cry, holding up a lantern to light the
cell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;Very good! Go to bed again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two hours later there would be another rattling
of bolts, other deputies would appear, and again the
Prince would be roused from his sleep and compelled,
half-naked and shivering with cold and
terror, to answer the questions of his jailers. This
persecution soon exhausted him mentally and
physically. The lack of fresh air, the darkness
and solitude, benumbed all his faculties. He no
longer wept. His feeble hands could scarcely lift
the earthen plate or jug in which his food and
water were brought. He had ceased to try to clean
his room; he no longer had even the strength to
shake up the sack of straw that formed his bed, or
to turn the mattress. The bedclothes were never
changed, and his pillow was in tatters; he could
not get clean linen or mend his ragged clothes;
he had not resolution enough to wash and clean
himself, but lay patiently on his bed most of the
time, his dull eyes staring into vacancy.</p>
<p>How often must he have prayed to God, &ldquo;When,
oh! when, will my sufferings end?&rdquo; How long&mdash;how
long it must have seemed before the Almighty
listened to the feeble voice and sent the blessed
release of death. But at last the petition was heard,
and a gleam of human pity brightened the last days
of this innocent victim of man&rsquo;s cruelty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>After the execution of Robespierre<a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a> and his associates
in the Reign of Terror, better days dawned
for the little Prince. The new government sent
him a jailer named Laurent, who was kind and
humane, and dared to show his pity for his prisoner.
He had the barred door opened, and, horror-stricken
at the sight disclosed, at once took measures to
relieve the poor child, whom he found cowering on
a filthy bed, clothed in rags, his back bent as if with
age, his little body covered with sores. The once
lovely child showed scarcely a trace of his former
beauty. His face was yellow and emaciated, his
eyes dim and sunken; he was ill, and the bright
and vigorous mind was no longer active. &ldquo;I
want to die! I want to die!&rdquo; were the only words
Laurent was able to draw from him at his first
visit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>The kindly jailer lost no time in bettering his
situation as far as he could. The barred door with
the wicket was removed, the shutters taken down
from the windows to admit the light and air freely,
and the cell thoroughly cleaned. One of his first
cares was to have the boy bathed, cleaned, and
placed in another bed. He also sent for a physician,
and ordered a tailor to make some new clothes
for his charge. At first the poor little Prince could
not understand these expressions of sympathy and
kindness. He had suffered so much and so deeply
from the inhumanity of men, that his crushed sensibilities
were slow in starting to life again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you trouble yourself about me?&rdquo; he
asked one day, and when Laurent made some
kindly answer, added, with a swelling heart, &ldquo;I
thought no one cared for me any more!&rdquo; while
he tried to hide his tears.</p>
<p>Simon had introduced the custom of addressing
the Prince simply as &ldquo;Capet&rdquo;; Laurent changed
this, and called him by his first name, &ldquo;M. Charles.&rdquo;
He also obtained permission for him to walk on
the platform of the Tower whenever he chose, and
enjoy the blue sky and the sunshine again after his
long, sad imprisonment. Here, one day, he found
some little yellow flowers that were trying to live in
the seams and crevices of the crumbling stone. He
gathered them eagerly, and tied them into a little
nosegay, recalling, perhaps, the sunny days of his
early childhood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>On the ninth of November, 1794, a second jailer
arrived&mdash;a man named Gomin, who, like Laurent,
was kind and tender-hearted. It was settled between
them that they should share the same room,
an arrangement which suited Laurent very well,
since it gave him more freedom; and both men
exerted themselves to make their little captive&rsquo;s
dull days as cheerful as possible. They would have
done even more for him had they not been restrained
by the presence of a deputy, who was required
to share their guard over the Dauphin.
These deputies were frequently changed. If the
choice of their superiors happened to fall on a man
who was friendly and obliging, Laurent and Gomin
could usually obtain small favors from him. Thus,
on the third day after his arrival in the Temple,
Gomin made use of the good-will of a deputy
named Bresson to obtain for the Prince four plants
in pots, all in full bloom. The sight of these
flowers was a most wonderful surprise to the poor
child, and his eyes filled with tears of joy and happiness.
He went around and around them, as if
intoxicated with delight, clasped them in his arms,
and inhaled their fragrance. He devoured them
with his eyes, examined every blossom, and finally
picked one. Then he looked at Gomin with a
troubled expression; an innocent, childish memory
trembled in his heart. He thought of his mother!
Alas, poor child! For her no more should earthly
flowers bloom, nor wert thou ever to be permitted
to lay a blossom on her grave!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>Soon after this, a deputy named Delboy came to
the Temple. He was coarse and uncouth in appearance,
and had a gruff, harsh voice. With an air
of brutality, he opened all the prison doors, and
behaved in a rude and boorish manner; but under
this rough exterior was concealed a softness of heart
and highmindedness that greatly surprised the little
prisoner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why this miserable food?&rdquo; he said one day,
glancing at the Dauphin&rsquo;s scanty meal. &ldquo;If he
were in the Tuileries, we might question what he
had to eat&mdash;but here in our hands! We should
be merciful to him; the nation is magnanimous!
What are these shutters for? Under the government
of the people, the sun shines for all, and this
child is entitled to his share of it. Why should a
brother be prevented from seeing his sister? Our
watchword is fraternity!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>The Prince gazed at him in open-eyed astonishment,
and followed every movement of this rough
stranger, whose friendly words were such a contrast
to his forbidding aspect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it not so, my boy,&rdquo; continued the deputy;
&ldquo;would you not be very happy if you could play
with your sister? I do not see why the nation
should remember your origin if you forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, turning to Laurent and Gomin, he added:
&ldquo;It is not his fault that he is the son of a King.
He is only a child&mdash;an unfortunate one, too&mdash;and
should not be treated so harshly. He is, at least, a
human being; and is not France the mother of all
her children?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>After his departure, Gomin hastened to procure
more comforts for the Prince, and took pains to see
that he had a light in his room at night, for which
the poor child was very grateful. He was not
allowed to see his sister, Marie Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, however,
as the government had strictly forbidden it. But
all the care and attention of his jailers could not
save him from being attacked by a bad fever, and
unfortunately the deputies were not all so considerate
as the rough but kindly Delboy. Some of
them terrified him by harsh threats and insults,
which by no means improved his condition. One
man, named Careaux, to whom Gomin applied for
permission to send for a physician for the sick child,
had the heartless insolence to reply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pah! never mind him. There are plenty of
children dying all the time who are of more consequence
than he!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A day or two afterward, Gomin was painfully surprised
to hear the poor boy, muttering to himself,
repeat the words, &ldquo;Many children die who are of
more consequence!&rdquo; and from this time he sank
into a state of the deepest melancholy and failed
rapidly. It was with difficulty that Gomin could
induce him to go up to the roof of the Tower, even
when he had the strength; and soon, indeed, his feet
could no longer support him, and his jailers were
obliged to carry him up in their arms. The disease
made such terrible progress in a few days that the
government finally felt it necessary to send a deputation
to the Temple to inquire into the condition
of the prisoner. Nothing came of it, however.
No physician was summoned, no remedies applied,
and the Dauphin was left to sink slowly into the
grave. It was plain that his death had been determined
on by the government, and disease was
allowed to finish the work which that unspeakable
wretch, the cobbler Simon, had begun so well.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>Gomin still had hope, nevertheless, and used
every means in his power to add to the child&rsquo;s small
pleasures and recreations. He found some books,
which the Prince read eagerly; and, through an acquaintance
named Debierne, obtained a turtle-dove
for him, but it did not live long. They often
played draughts together; the Prince did not understand
the game very well, but the kind-hearted
jailer always contrived to let his small opponent
win. Shuttlecock, too, was a favorite amusement
when the child&rsquo;s strength permitted, and at this he
proved very skilful. His eye was sure, his hand
quick, and he always rested the left one lightly on
his hip while the right was busy with the battledore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>On the twenty-ninth of March, 1795, Laurent
left the Temple, and was replaced by Etienne Lasne,
a house painter and soldier of the Guard. The
Prince thereby lost one friend, but gained another,
for Lasne from the beginning showed the heartiest
good-will toward him, and soon learned how to win
his affection. He would spend hours playing with
him, sing lively songs while Gomin joined in with
his violin, or entertain him with humorous fancies;
and his devotion so won the child&rsquo;s love and confidence
that the Dauphin always used the familiar
&ldquo;thou&rdquo; in speaking to him, although such had
never been his custom.</p>
<p>All this time the condition of the little Dauphin
had been growing worse so steadily that finally, at
the urgent demands of the jailers, a physician was
sent for. M. Desault treated him and prescribed
some remedies, though he gave Gomin to understand
from the first that he had little hope of the
boy&rsquo;s recovery. They moved him into a room that
was more light and sunny, but he was very weak,
and the change did little to check the progress of
the disease. Though his kind friend often carried
him up to the platform on the Tower, the slight improvement
wrought by breathing the fresh air scarcely
compensated for the fatigue the effort cost him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>In the course of centuries, the rain had hollowed
out a sort of little basin on the battlements of the
platform, where the water would remain for several
days, and as there were frequent rains in the spring of
1795, this reservoir was never empty. Every time
the Prince was carried to the roof, he saw a number
of sparrows that came daily to the little pool to
drink and bathe in it. At first they would fly away
at his approach, but after a time they became accustomed
to seeing him, and only took flight when
he came too close. They were always the same
ones, and he learned to know them. Perhaps they,
like himself, had grown familiar with the old Tower.
He called them his birds. As soon as the door
was opened, his first glance would be toward the
little basin, and the sparrows were always there.
When he approached, they would all rise in the air,
fluttering and chirping; but after he had passed, they
would settle down again at once. Supported by his
jailer&rsquo;s arm and leaning against the wall, he would
often stand perfectly motionless for a long time,
watching the birds alight and dip their little beaks
in the water, then their breasts, fluttering their
wings and shaking the drops off their feathers,
while the poor little invalid would clasp his keeper&rsquo;s
arm tightly, as if to say: &ldquo;Alas! I cannot do that!&rdquo;
Sometimes, with this support, he would take several
steps forward, till he was so near he could almost
touch them with his outstretched arm. This was
his greatest pleasure; he loved their cheerful twittering
and quick, alert motions.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>The physician, M. Desault, came every morning
at nine o&rsquo;clock to see his patient, and often
remained with him for some time. The Prince
was very fond of the good old man, and showed his
gratitude both in words and looks. Suddenly,
however, his visits ceased, and they learned that he
had died unexpectedly on the thirty-first of May.
The little Prince wept when he was told of it, and
mourned sincerely for his kind friend. The chief
surgeon, M. Pelletan, took his place; but he, too,
had no hope of being able to prolong the life of the
child, who, like a delicate plant deprived of light
and air, gradually drooped and faded. Yet he bore
his sufferings without a murmur or complaint.
The plant was dying; its bright colors were gone,
but its sweet fragrance remained to the last.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>M. Pelletan, who realized only too well his dangerous
condition, had requested from the government
the advice and assistance of another physician,
and on the seventh of June M. Dumaugin was sent to
accompany him to the Temple. The Prince&rsquo;s weakness
had increased alarmingly, and that morning,
after having taken his medicine and been rubbed
as usual, he had sunk into a sort of swoon, which
made the jailers fear the end was near. He revived
a little, however, when the physicians arrived;
but they saw plainly it was useless to attempt
to check the malady. They ordered a glass of
sweetened water to be given to him, to cool his dry,
parched mouth, if he should wish to drink, and
withdrew with a painful sense of their helplessness.
M. Pelletan was of the opinion that the little Prince
would not live through another day, but his colleague
did not think the end would come so soon.
It was agreed that M. Pelletan should make his
visit at eight o&rsquo;clock the next morning, and M.
Dumaugin was to come at eleven.</p>
<p>When Gomin entered the room that evening
with the Dauphin&rsquo;s supper, he was pleasantly surprised
to find the sick child a little improved. His
color was better, his eyes brighter, his voice stronger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is you!&rdquo; he said at once to his jailer,
with evident pleasure at seeing him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not suffering so much now?&rdquo; asked
Gomin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so much,&rdquo; answered the Prince softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must thank this room for that,&rdquo; said
Gomin. &ldquo;Here there is at least fresh air to breathe,
and plenty of light; the good doctors come to see
you, and you should find a little comfort in all this.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>At these words the Prince looked up at his jailer
with an expression of deepest sadness. His eyes
grew dim, then shone suddenly bright again, as a
tear trickled through his lashes and rolled down his
cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alone&mdash;always alone!&rdquo; was his answer. &ldquo;And
my mother has been over there, in that other Tower,
all this time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not know that she, as well as his aunt,
Madame &Eacute;lisabeth, had long since been dragged to
the guillotine, and all the warmth and tenderness of
which the poor child&rsquo;s heart was still capable of
feeling were fixed on the mother from whose arms
he had been so cruelly torn. This childish affection
had survived through everything; it was as
strong as his will, as deep as his nature. &ldquo;Love,&rdquo;
says the Holy Scriptures, &ldquo;is stronger than death,&rdquo;
and this child confirmed the saying. Now, when
his mind was dwelling on memories of the past and
the recollection of his sufferings, every other
thought was forgotten, and his tried and tortured
heart had room for no other image than that of his
dearly and tenderly beloved mother.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is true you are often alone here, and that is
sad, to be sure,&rdquo; continued Gomin; &ldquo;but then you
no longer have the sight of so many bad men
around you, or the example of so many wicked
actions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I have seen enough of them,&rdquo; murmured
the child; &ldquo;but,&rdquo; he added in a gentler tone,
laying his hand on the arm of his kindly jailer and
raising his eyes to his face, &ldquo;I see good people also,
and they keep me from being angry with those who
are not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this, Gomin said suddenly: &ldquo;That wicked
Careaux you have seen here so often, as deputy, has
been arrested, and is now in prison himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Careaux?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;He did not treat
me well. But I am sorry. Is he here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, in La Force, in the Quartier St. Antoine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An ordinary nature would have harbored some
feeling of revenge, but this royal child had the
greatness of soul to pity his persecutor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry for him; he is more unhappy
than we, for he deserves his misfortunes!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>Words so simple and yet so noble, on the lips of
a child scarcely ten years old, may be wondered at;
nevertheless, they were actually spoken by the
Dauphin, and the words themselves did not impress
Gomin so much as the sincere and touching tone in
which they were spoken. Without doubt, misfortune
and suffering had matured the child&rsquo;s mind
prematurely, and he may have been inspired by some
invisible presence from above, such as God often
sends to the bedside of the suffering and dying.</p>
<p>Night came on&mdash;the last night the poor little
prisoner was to spend in solitude and loneliness, with
only those old companions, misery of mind and
body. He had always been left alone at night, even
during his illness; and not until eight o&rsquo;clock in the
morning were his jailers allowed to go to him. We
do not know how the Prince passed that last night,
or whether he waked or slept; but in either case
death was hovering close beside his pillow. The
next morning, Monday, the eighth of June, Lasne
entered the room between seven and eight o&rsquo;clock,
Gomin not daring to go first for fear he should not
find their charge alive. But by the time M. Pelletan
arrived the Prince was sitting up, and Lasne thought
he had even improved somewhat since the day
before, though the physician&rsquo;s more experienced eye
told him there was no change for the better. Indeed,
the poor little invalid, whose feet felt strangely heavy,
soon wanted to lie down again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>When M. Dumaugin came at eleven o&rsquo;clock, the
Prince was in bed; but he welcomed him with the
unvarying gentleness and sweetness that had never
deserted him through all his troubles, and to which
the physician himself testified later on. He shrugged
his shoulders over the patient&rsquo;s condition, and felt
that the end was not far off. After he had taken
his leave, Gomin replaced Lasne in the sick room.
He seated himself near the bed, but, fearing to rouse
or disturb the child, did not speak. The Prince
never began a conversation, and was silent likewise,
gazing mournfully at his friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How unhappy it makes me to see you suffer so
much!&rdquo; said Gomin at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; answered the child softly, &ldquo;I
shall not always suffer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gomin knelt down by the bed to be nearer him,
and the affectionate child seized his keeper&rsquo;s hand
and pressed it to his lips. At this, Gomin gave way
to his emotion, and his heart went out in prayer&mdash;the
prayer that man in his deepest sorrow sends up
to the all-merciful Father; while the Prince, still
clasping the faithful hand in his, raised his eyes to
heaven with a look of angelic peace and holiness
impossible to describe. After a time, Gomin,
seeing that he lay quiet and motionless, said to
him:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you do not suffer now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I still suffer,&rdquo; whispered the Prince,
&ldquo;but much less&mdash;the music is so beautiful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, there was no music in or near the Temple
at this solemn moment; no noise of any kind from
outside entered the room where the soul of the little
martyr was preparing for flight. Gomin, much
surprised, therefore, asked him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where does the music come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From above there!&rdquo; replied the child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it long that you have heard it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since you knelt down by me and prayed.
Have you not heard it? Listen&mdash;listen now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a quick motion he held up his feeble hand,
his blue eyes shining with rapture, while Gomin,
not wishing to dispel this last sweet illusion of the
dying child, made a pious effort to hear what could
not be heard, and pretended to be listening to the
music. In a few moments the Prince raised himself
suddenly and cried out in an ecstasy of joy:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! among all those voices I can hear my
mother&rsquo;s!&rdquo; and as this holy name escaped the
orphan&rsquo;s lips, all his pain and sorrow seemed to disappear.
His eyebrows, drawn with suffering, relaxed
and his eyes sparkled with the light of victory
and freedom. But the radiance of his glance was
soon dimmed; the old worn look came back to his
face and he sank back, his hands crossed meekly on
his breast. Gomin watched him closely and followed
all his movements with anxious eyes. His breathing
was not more difficult, but his eyes wandered about
vacantly and absently, and were often fixed on the
window. Gomin asked if anything troubled him,
but he did not seem to hear even when the question
was repeated, and made no reply. Lasne came soon
after to relieve Gomin, who left his little friend with
a heavy heart, although he did not realize the end
was so near. Lasne sat by the bed for a long time
in silence, the Prince gazing at him sorrowfully; but
when he moved a little, Lasne asked him how he
felt and whether he wanted anything. Instead of
replying, he asked abruptly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think my sister could hear the music?
It would make her so happy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lasne could not answer this. The yearning eyes
of the dying boy, dark with the anguish of death,
were turned toward the window. Suddenly a cry
of joy escaped him; then, turning to Lasne, he said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have something to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The jailer took his hand&mdash;the little head drooped
upon his breast&mdash;he listened, but in vain. The
last word had been spoken! God had spared the
little Dauphin the last agonizing death-struggle,
and in a last dream of joy and rapture had taken
him to His loving arms!</p>
<p>Lasne laid his hand gently on the child&rsquo;s heart,
but it no longer beat. That troubled heart was quiet
now. The little Dauphin had exchanged his sorrowful
earthly dwelling for the eternal peace and
happiness of Heaven&mdash;had found his loved ones
and his God.<a class="fn" id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a></p>

<p>Only a few more words, gentle reader. I have
unrolled a sad picture before you, and, however
much it may have excited your sympathy, it could
not be softened, for from beginning to end it is the
truth and only the truth. The little Dauphin,
Louis Charles, the son of a King and a King himself,
really bore all these sorrows; he lived, suffered,
and died as has been described in these pages. A
conscientious and reliable investigator, M. de Beauchesne,
has with untold zeal and patience collected
all the incidents here recounted; and the facts have
been corroborated by Lasne and Gomin, the two
worthy men who tried to brighten the last days of
the unfortunate little Prince.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>And now, should you ask what moral is to be
drawn from this true narrative, I would answer:
Learn from the perusal of this child&rsquo;s life to be submissive
under affliction and trouble. God keep you
from pain and sorrow; but, should they one day fall
to your lot, then remember the little Dauphin and
King of France, and endure, as he endured, suffering
and heart-break with calmness and patience, with
humility and submission to the will of the Lord,
before whose mysterious and inscrutable decrees
weak mortality must bow without repining.</p>

Antoinette, was born at Versailles March 27, 1785, became Dauphin in 1789, and
three years later was imprisoned in the Temple, where he died June 8, 1795. At
the time this story opens, he was the only son. His brother, Louis Joseph Xavier
Fran&ccedil;ois, born October 22, 1781, died June 7, 1789. He had two sisters, Maria
Theresa Charlotte, born December 19, 1778, married the Duke d&rsquo;Angoul&ecirc;me,
eldest son of Charles X of France, died October 19, 1851; and Sophia H&eacute;l&egrave;ne
Beatrice, born July 9, 1786, died June 16, 1787.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_2" href="#fr_2">[2]</a>Louis XVI,
grandson of Louis XV, was born at Versailles August 23, 1754.
In 1770 he married Marie Antoinette, daughter of the Emperor Francis I and
Maria Theresa, of Austria. Louis XVI was guillotined January 21, 1793, and
Marie Antoinette October 16, 1793.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_3" href="#fr_3">[3]</a>The
Champ de Mars is a large square on the left bank of the Seine, devoted
to military exercises. From a very early period it has been the scene of battles,
riots, pageants, festivals, and great public gatherings. Besides the F&ecirc;te of the Federation,
sometimes called the &ldquo;Feast of the Pikes,&rdquo; mentioned above, it was the
scene of the Massacres in 1791, and of the &ldquo;F&ecirc;te &agrave; l&rsquo;&Ecirc;tre supr&ecirc;me,&rdquo; the latter a
festival in which an effort was made, under the auspices of Robespierre, who had
obtained a decree from the Assembly recognizing the existence of the Supreme
Being and the immortality of the soul, to set up a new religion in the place of
Catholicism and reason worship. Carlyle calls it &ldquo;the shabbiest page of human
annals.&rdquo;
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_4" href="#fr_4">[4]</a>The Marquis de Lafayette
was not only a statesman, but a soldier. He served
with great distinction in the War of the American Revolution, commanded the
French National Guard, 1789-90, fought the Austrians in 1792, commanded the
National Guard in 1830, and helped place Louis Philippe on the throne. He came
to this country twice, the second time in 1824.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_5" href="#fr_5">[5]</a>Talleyrand, a French abb&eacute;, was made Bishop of Autun in 1788, but he
was much more celebrated as a statesman and diplomatist. He was prominent in
all the political events of French history from 1789 to 1834, and was also a leading
figure in all the diplomatic affairs of that period. He died at Paris
May 17, 1838.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_6" href="#fr_6">[6]</a>Varennes-en-Argonne is a small town in the department of Meuse on the river Aire.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_7" href="#fr_7">[7]</a>Arnaud Berquin, a French author, was born at Langoiran in 1749, and died
at Paris in 1791. He was famous as a writer for children. Among his most
popular works are &ldquo;The Children&rsquo;s Friend&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Little Grandison.&rdquo;
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_8" href="#fr_8">[8]</a>The Marquis de Bouill&eacute;, a French general, was born at Auvergne in 1739, and
died at London in 1800. He was governor in the Antilles from 1768 to 1782,
and when the French Revolution broke out was in command at Metz. In 1790
he quelled the mutiny of the garrison at Nancy, and in the following year made an
effort to get Louis XVI out of the country; failing in which, he fled to England,
where he died a few years afterward.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_9" href="#fr_9">[9]</a>&Eacute;lisabeth
Philippine Marie H&eacute;l&egrave;ne, sister of Louis XVI, was born at
Versailles, May 3, 1764, and was guillotined May 10, 1794. Of her courage at
the scaffold, Carlyle says &ldquo;Another row of tumbrils we must notice: that which
holds &Eacute;lisabeth, the sister of Louis. Her trial was like the rest, for plots, for
plots. She was among the kindliest, most innocent of women. There sat with
her, amid four-and-twenty others, a once timorous Marchioness de Crussol,
courageous now, expressing toward her the liveliest loyalty. At the foot of the
scaffold, &Eacute;lisabeth, with tears in her eyes, thanked this marchioness, said she
was grieved she could not reward her. &lsquo;Ah! Madame, would your Royal Highness
deign to embrace me, my wishes were complete.&rsquo; &lsquo;Right willingly, Marquise
de Crussol, and with my whole heart.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_10" href="#fr_10">[10]</a>Count de Axel Fersen, who accompanied the King in this flight, was born at
Stockholm, September 4, 1755, and was murdered in the same city, June 20, 1810,
by the populace, who suspected that he and his sister had been concerned in the death
of Prince Christian of Holstein-Augustenburg, who was to be the successor of
Charles XIII. Count Fersen was commander of the Royal Swedish Regiment in
the service of Louis XVI.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_11" href="#fr_11">[11]</a>&ldquo;Nor is Postmaster Drouet unobservant all this while, but steps out and
steps in, with his long flowing nightgown, in the level sunlight, prying into several
things.... That lady in slouched gypsy-hat, though sitting back in the carriage,
does she not resemble someone we have seen sometime&mdash;at the Feast of Pikes or
elsewhere? And this Grosse-T&ecirc;te in round hat and peruke, which, looking rearward,
pokes itself out from time to time, methinks there are features in it&mdash;? Quick,
Sieur Guillaume, Clerk of the Directoire, bring me a new assignat! Drouet
scans the new assignat, compares the paper-money picture with the Gross Head in
round hat there, by day and night; you might say the one was an attempted
engraving of the other. And this march of troops, this sauntering and whispering&mdash;I
see it.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Carlyle&rsquo;s</i> &ldquo;<i>French Revolution.</i>&rdquo;
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_12" href="#fr_12">[12]</a>Antoine Pierre Barnave,
one of the French revolutionists, was deputy to the
Third Estate in 1789, and President of the National Assembly in 1790. He was
arrested for alleged treason in 1791, and was guillotined in 1793.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_13" href="#fr_13">[13]</a>P&eacute;tion, mentioned in this connection, another of the revolutionists, was
President of the Constituent Assembly in 1790, and Mayor of Paris in 1791-92.
He was proscribed in June, 1793, but escaped, and at last committed suicide near
Bordeaux in 1794.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_14" href="#fr_14">[14]</a>The Temple
was a fortified structure of the Knights Templars, built in 1128.
After the order was abolished in 1312, it was used for various purposes. The
chapel remained until 1650, and the square tower, where the royal family were
imprisoned, was destroyed in 1810.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_15" href="#fr_15">[15]</a>The Princess de Lamballe was the daughter of the Prince de Carignan of the
house of Savoy-Carignan, and an intimate friend of Marie Antoinette, and shared
the latter&rsquo;s imprisonment in the Temple. She married the Prince de Lamballe, a
great-grandson of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan. She was put to death
in 1792, because she refused to take the oath against the monarchy. Carlyle, in
his &ldquo;French Revolution,&rdquo; says of her murder: &ldquo;The brave are not spared, nor
the beautiful, nor the weak. Princess de Lamballe has lain down on bed.
&lsquo;Madame, you are to be removed to the Abbaye&rsquo; (the military prison at St. Germain-des-Pr&eacute;s).
&lsquo;I do not wish to remove; I am well enough here.&rsquo; There is
a need-be for removing. She will arrange her dress a little, then. Rude voices
answer: &lsquo;You have not far to go!&rsquo;&rdquo; The sad story of her fate is told in the
last outcry from the mob. Although innocent of any offence, unless sympathy with
the royal family or friendship with Marie Antoinette were an offence, she was executed.
She went calmly to the guillotine and bravely gave up her life.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_16" href="#fr_16">[16]</a>History relates that the King mounted the scaffold without hesitation and
without fear, but when the executioners approached to bind him he resisted them,
deeming it an affront to his dignity and a reflection upon his courage. The Abb&eacute;
who had accompanied him, as a spiritual consoler, reminded him that the Saviour
had submitted to be bound, whereupon Louis, who was of a very pious nature, at
once consented, though still protesting against the indignity of the act. Before the
fatal moment, he advanced to the edge of the scaffold and said to the people:
&ldquo;Frenchmen, I die innocent; it is from the scaffold and near appearing before
God that I tell you so. I pardon my enemies. I desire that France&mdash;&rdquo;
The sentence was left unfinished, for at that instant the signal was given the executioner.
The Abb&eacute; leaning towards the King said: &ldquo;Son of Saint Louis,
ascend to Heaven.&rdquo; Undoubtedly the reason for the interruption of the King&rsquo;s
last words was the fear of popular sympathy, for notwithstanding the revolutionary
frenzy he was personally liked by many.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_17" href="#fr_17">[17]</a> The Carmagnole was originally a Proven&ccedil;al dance tune, which was frequently
adapted to songs of various import. During the Revolution, so-called patriotic
words were set to it, and it was sung, like the &ldquo;Marseillaise,&rdquo; to inspire popular
wrath against royalty.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_18" href="#fr_18">[18]</a>Jean Paul Marat, the French revolutionist, was born in Switzerland in 1744.
He was both physician and scientist in his earlier years, but at the outbreak of the
Revolution took a prominent part in the agitation for a republic, and incited the
people to violence. In 1792 he was elected to the National Convention, and in
1793 was tried before the Revolutionary Tribunal as an ultra-revolutionist, but was
acquitted. July 13, 1793, he was assassinated by Charlotte Corday, who was
guillotined for the murder four days later.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_19" href="#fr_19">[19]</a>Saumur is a town in the department of Maine-et-Loire, on the Loire River.
It was here that the Vendeans, who were partisans of the royal rising against the
Revolution and the Republic, won a victory over the Republican Army June 9,
1793, and took the town.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_20" href="#fr_20">[20]</a>Marie Antoinette died upon the scaffold as bravely as the King had done.
Her trial was a mock one, for her execution had been decided upon before she was
tried. She was never liked by the French people, and all sorts of charges had been
made against her, many of them untrue. She had inherited her ideas of royalty
and absolution from her mother, Maria Theresa of Austria, and never showed any
interest in the lower classes. Her biographer in the Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica says:
&ldquo;In the Marie Antoinette who suffered on the guillotine we pity, not the pleasure-loving
Queen; not the widow who had kept her husband against his will in the
wrong course; not the woman who throughout her married life did not scruple to
show her contempt for her slow and heavy but good-natured and loving King, but
the little princess, sacrificed to state policy and cast uneducated and without a helper
into the frivolous court of France, not to be loved but to be suspected by all around
her and eventually to be hated by the whole people of France.&rdquo;
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_21" href="#fr_21">[21]</a>Maximilien Robespierre, one of the most prominent among the revolutionists,
was the leader of the extreme Left in the Constituent Assembly, and a member of
the Committee of Public Safety in 1793. He was also identified with the Reign
of Terror, but was finally stripped of all his power, and was guillotined July 28,
1794.

<p>The &ldquo;life-stories&rdquo; retain the story form throughout, and embody
in each chapter a stirring event in the life of the hero or the action
of the time. The dramatis person&aelig; are actual characters, and the
facts in the main are historically correct. They are therefore both
entertaining and instructive, and present biography in its most attractive
form for the young.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
